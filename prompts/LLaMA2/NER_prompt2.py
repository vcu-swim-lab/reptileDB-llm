An entity is an anatomical feature of an organism (anatomical), a measurable quantitative trait (quantitative), a physical characteristic that describes appearance (physical). Species, family, order, dates, times, persons, references, verbs, and general background information are not entities.

Amphisbaena innocens Sauria Amphisbaenidae DESCRIPTION: Size large (SVL to 262 mm); tail to 18 mm, conical, rounded terminally; no caudal autotomy; body annuli 186-219, caudal annuli 10-15; dorsal segments 14-17/midbody annulus, ventral segments 18-22/midbody annulus; 3 rows of postgenials; no postmalar chin shields;  4-6 (strongly modally 4) precloacal pores; nasal suture rather long but less than one-half length of prefrontal suture; 1 temporal. Dorsum (as preserved) shades of brown, at times with dark violet head and tail, grading to chocolate brown on body; color solid on head and tail, on body rectangular centers of each segment much darker than margins, giving the impression of dark spots; color darker dorsally than ventrally but no white segments (Schwartz & Henderson 1991: 560). For a discussion of geographic variation see Gans & Alexander 1962: 101.
