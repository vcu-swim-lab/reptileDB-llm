Amphisbaena alba	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	DIAGNOSIS: A large, blunt-nosed form of Amphisbaena without fusion of head segments, unicolored when adult, with a high number of segments to a midbody annulus, and lacking a caudal autotomy constriction. Specimens have 198 to 248 body annuli| 13 to 21 caudal annuli| 65 to 85 (30-42 dorsal| 35-46 ventral) segments per midbody annulus| and four to 10 precloacal pores.  (Gans 1962)DESCRIPTION: Meristic data for Brazilian specimens are cited from Vanzolini (1955). Counts by me on non-Brazilian specimens fall within. these ranges. Figures 4 through 6 show views of heads of juvenile and adult| figures 2 and 3, the juvenile color pattern| and figures 1 and 7, the ventral surfaces of cloaca and tail. Preserved specimens are a uniformn yellow-tan, brown, or brownish pink dorsally and slightly lighter ventrally. Juveniles may have a dorsal pattern of irregular darker spots (figs. 2, 3). There is no tendency toward darkening of the segmental centers. For a colored photograph of a live specimen, see Schmidt and Inger (1957, fig. 57). The head scalation shows considerable variability and is often asymmetrical (cf. Brongersma, 1932). The description (following Gans and Alexander, MS) is hence of the general pattern, almost all elements of which have been observed to vary in one specimen or another. An azygous rostral is followed by three pairs of enlarged cephalic shields in contact along the dorsal midline, with the nostrils pierced in the first pair (nasals). The second pair (prefrontals) are the largest segments of the head. There are four supralabials and three infralabials. The first three supralabials are large, and particularly the third one may be split in some individuals (fig. 4). The first two pairs of infralabials are large. The third is narrow and generally widest at its posterior end. There is a single row of temporal (postocular) segments, varying in number, and lying between the fourth supralabial and the frontal. The T-shaped mental is followed by a slightly larger, heart-shaped postmental, often in point contact posterolaterally with a pair of large malars. There are normally two segments in the first postgenial, and two to three in the second postgenial, row. The number of the latter may be increased to five or more by a splitting off of the posteromedial corners of the malars. There is a row of from 12 to 15 postmalars. The snout is blunt, flattened slightly dorsoventrally, and oval in cross section. The upper jaw projects beyond the lower which inserts between the projecting supralabials. The shape of the head is strongly affected by the allometric growth pattern of the temporal musculature (contrast fig. 5 and fig. 6, middle view). The skin bulges away from the skull in the temporal region to an extent sufficient to produce a convex curvature just posterior to the eyes. The middorsal line is more closely attached to the parietal crest of the supraoccipital, so that adults also show a depression between the bulging temporal muscles. One to two dorsal half-annuli insert after the first or second body annulus. The first six to eight annuli are narrowed, and the sixth annulus generally marks the level of the head joint, which is apparent by a noticeable but not conspicuous constriction. The dorsal grooves are poorly defined except on the head and tail. The ventral groove is indicated mainly as a gap between aligned segments. The lateral grooves are well defined, starting gradually after the first fifth of the body. They are often crossed with diagonal fold lines that seem to facilitate adjustment of the skin when the body is twisted. The dorsal segments are much narrower than long| the ventral ones are square at midbody. The precloacal pores lie in a single uninterrupted row of normal-sized or slightly wider segments anterior to the precloacal shield. The precloacals generally number more than 10 elongate, parallel-sided segments. The postcloacals, slightly greater in number, are characterized by a central group of two to four enlarged segments, flanked on each side by a group of very narrow segments, the deep sutures between which enter the cloaca laterally as a series of parallel cross lines. The cloaca may be entirely prolapsed. The tail is of constant diameter up to the blunt end, which is capped by a group of segments with decreased intersegmental differentiation (Gans 1962).<br>

Amphisbaena angustifrons	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	DIAGNOSIS: A medium to large-sized species of Amphisbaena, with the post-rostral  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  shields paired and without major fusions of  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  shields| with an elongate, acutely pointed  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  terminating in a narrow, faintly spatulate tip, and with a short, conically reduced  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  that lacks an autotomy annulus and cannot be autotomized. Specimens have 190 to 215 (occasionally to 253) <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span> | 12 to 18  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span> | and means of 20 to 31 dorsal and 21 to 30 ventral segments to a midbody annulus. Four, rarely three, five, or six precloacal pores. Living specimens brownish above, lighter below, with reddish purple overtones. Pigmentation appearing concentrated along anterior portions of segments which are otherwise evenly colored. (Gans 1965)DESCRIPTION: The characteristics of the Mendoza, La Pampa, and Neuquen specimens are given in parentheses when they differ from those of the rest of the material. Meristic characters are summarized in table  <span style="color: green;">1</span>  Figure 5 shows views of the  <span style="color: red;">head</span> | figure 6, the ventral surface of the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span> | and figures 7, 8, 9, and 10 show photographs of segment proportions and pattern details. Figures 2 and  <span style="color: green;">3</span>  show relative  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  length and size variation. This is a medium to large, robust species of Amphisbaena, in life of uniform dark brown dorsal and somewhat lighter ventral coloration. The segmental pigmentation is uniform except for the marked increase in its density on the anterior part of each segment. Countershading occurs by the fading out of the pigment on the posterior half of a segment, and the differential becomes more noticeable on preserved specimens. The rostral tip, the ventral part of the supralabials, and the middle of the chin shields are light colored in life and bleach to white in preservatives. The ventral countershading is less marked along the first tenth of the body and beneath the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  The  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  segments show no major fusions. The middorsal segments of the first rows following the frontals are of regular size, without significant enlargement. The  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  is pointed and slopes in a straight line at an acute angle toward the rostral tip, which is faintly spatulate horizontally, much like a horizontally cylindrical swollen edge. This slope is covered by the enlarged nasal, prefrontal, and frontal shields. The rostral edge and the anterior portion of these shields often give the impression of a faintly keratinized surface. The  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  is somewhat smaller than the trunk, set off slightly by the reduction of the nape posterior to the bulging  <span style="color: red;">temporal</span>  muscles. The nuchal region widens markedly at the level of the twentieth to thirtieth body annulus where the trunk achieves its greatest diameter. The trunk is subcylindrical in cross section and shows slight horizontal compression. In size the rostral is approximately equal to the first supralabial, these segments sharing a very short common suture. In dorsal view the rostral appears as a tiny triangle, if at all. Ventrally, it covers an area greater than that of the mental. Pairs of large nasals, much larger prefrontals, and smaller frontals follow in sequence along the dorsal midline of the  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  The frontals may be divided by a pair of sutures that form a posteriorly acute angle with the midline. Various modifications occur, and some specimens have the sutures which end blindly in the frontals. The dorsal segments of the first body annulus may be slightly enlarged, but never sufficiently to be considered parietals. The frontals thus extend posteriorly to a level anterior to the start of the  <span style="color: red;">temporal</span>  bulges, which is equivalent to the middle of the third supralabial. There are four, rarely three, supralabials, the second the largest, the first, third, and fourth following in order of size. The fourth supralabial is generally a small, triangular segment cut off from the third| in cases in which only three supralabials are present, the suture is interrupted. Occasionally, as in one side of the holotype, the third supralabial is split by an ascending suture that divides off a wedge-shaped labial segment from the main portion of the shield. The first, second, and third interlabial sutures run anterodorsad at angles of 30 degrees, 45 degrees, and 45 degrees, respectively, to the labial edge. The fourth suture runs posterodorsad at 60 degrees. The ocular is more or less rectangular and is in contact with the second and third supralabials and prefrontal. It is in point contact with the frontal and in posterior contact with one or two enlarged segments of the first body annulus. The eye is large and clearly apparent. The lower jaw is fairly shallow and inserted within the prognathous snout. The mental is relatively small, flanked on each side by the some- what larger first infralabials which enclose the anterior aspect of the larger pentagonal postmental. The second of the three infralabials is by far the largest (its medial tip is separated by a suture in some specimens)| the third is the smallest. The malars are subtriangular, generally equivalent in area to the first infralabials, but of varying proportions. A pair of large drop-shaped or halfmoon-shaped segments of the first postgenial row surrounds the posterior aspect of the postmental, keep- ing it from contact with the malars. An occasionally enlarged median segment' of the first postgenial row in some cases projects to touch the postmental on the midline. The second postgenial row consists of two to four small central segments, flanked on each side by equivalent sized ones, giving the impression that they were cut off the posteromedial corners of the malars. Thus the total row numbers from four to seven, normally five, segments, of which the ventral one is often enlarged. The row is lacking in some of the specimens (including all three from Esquina Grande, Catamarca). The postmalar row contains nine to 14, normally 10 or 11, more or less regular, small segments. Dorsally the first body annulus sweeps forward to include the two enlarged, roughly rectangular segments, formerly referred to as  <span style="color: red;">temporal</span>  and postocular. A few specimens from the southwest have the postmalar row continuing dorsal to include the fourth supralabial, temporals, and postocular. There are one to two dorsal, intercalated half annuli in the nuchal region. These are generally inserted between the first and second and the second and third  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  The suture be tween the third and fourth  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  passes vertically| all anterior ones incline anterodorsad. The midventral segments of the first six to eight  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  are smaller and rounded, forming a more or less flexible throat region that appears concave in most preserved specimens. Some specimens show the twentieth to fiftieth annuli in a smooth, somewhat posteriorly concave curve in dorsal view.There are 190 to 215 (210 to 253) <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  from the level of the angulus oris up to and including the pore-bearing precloacals. There are 20 to 31 dorsal and 20 to 30 (means of 21 to 30) ventral segments to a midbody annulus. The variation here is remarkable in that there may be a difference of two to three between adjacent annuli. The dorsal surface also bears varied diagonal folding lines that cross the segments for varying distances. The dorsal segments are incompletely rectangular, and tiny equilateral triangular segments interdigitate between them on their posterior sutures, and there are traces of very tiny segments in the sutures of  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  The cloacal region is characterized by three to six (usually four) small, round, precloacal pores found even in juveniles and females, six to 10 precloacal segments, of which the six central ones are by far the largest, and 12 to 20 postcloacals, of which only the central pair is widened. The cloacal region corresponds to three to four, rarely and asymmetrically two, lateral annuli. It is followed by one to three, often rather narrow, postcloacal annuli which are the first of a total series of 12 to 18 (16 to 18) <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  that extends to the vertically oval caudal tip. There is no trace of an autotomy annulus| none of the specimens had an autotomized  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  and the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  of the living specimen would not autotomize. In section the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  appears ventrally flattened, dorsally curved, and wider than high, except for the distal tip which has a vertically oval cross section. The lateral sulci are clearly marked after approximately the thirty-. fifth body annulus and continue up to the level of the cloaca. They are as wide as or wider than a bordering segment and filled with irregularly shaped segmental fragments. There is barely a trace of a dorsal sulcus, and, where present, it is expressed as an alignment of intersegmental sutures. The ventral sulcus is similarly indicated. The middorsal segments are one and three-quarters to two times as long as wide. The midventral segments are wider than long, but there is marked size variability from annulus to annulus and even from side to side (Gans 1965).Diagnosis: Gans 1972: 12| for details on geographic variation see Gans 1965: 5, 13.Original description (knighti): Parker 1928: 383<br>

Amphisbaena carlgansi	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	DIAGNOSIS: Three Cuban species, Amphisbaena cubana, A. barbouri, and A. carlgansi, share a major fusion of head scales ( <span style="color: red;">ocular</span> + <span style="color: red;">second supralabial</span> ) not found in other Antillean species of the genus (Gans and Alexander, 1962). Therefore it is appropriate to compare A. carlgansi with A. cubana and A. barbouri. Of the three species, A. carlgansi is most similar to A. barbouri and thus the diagnostic differences distinguishing A. barbouri from A. cubana also distinguish A. carlgansi from A. cubana. Most notably, A. barbouri and A. carlgansi are smaller and more slender species with higher numbers of body and  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span> </span>  and lower interfrontal/interprefrontal and intemasal/ interprefrontal ratios (Table  <span style="color: green;">1</span> ). The most relevant comparison of A. carlgansi is with its presumed closest relative A. barbouri. The two species can be separated by a combination of the following characters: <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  length</span> / <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">svl</span> </span> ( <span style="color: green;">0.080-0.086</span>  in carlgansi, 0.060-0.079 in barbouri) (Fig. 3), coloration (pale pinkish-tan in carlgansi, medium brown in barbouri), number of  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span> </span> (212-228 [x̅ = 219] in carlgansi, 226-240 [x̅ = 233] in barbouri), and total midbody segments (31-34 [mode = 32] in carlgansi, 28-32 [mode = 30, 31] in barbouri) (Table  <span style="color: green;">1</span> ).

Amphisbaena caudalis	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Diagnosis: Amphisbaena caudalis is a moderate-sized (to  <span style="color: green;">247 mm</span>  <span style="color: red;">svl</span> ), slender, relatively short-headed, long-tailed species of Amphisbaena with caudal autotomy| it lacks major alterations of the head scales and has the Y chin configuration, has wide  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  posteriorly, a high number of  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span> </span>  and large “difference counts.” In small head size, slenderness, <span style="color: red;">long tails</span> ( <span style="color: green;">9-10% <span style="color: red;">svl</span> </span> ), high  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span> </span>  counts, and high “difference counts,” it superficially resembles A. hyporissor but differs from that species in having the Y chin configuration, and in the broad median contact of the first pair of parietals. Caudal autotomy occurs modally at annulus six in A. caudalis and annulus five in A. hyporissor. Amphisbaena hyporissor and A. gonavensis are similar in having the M chin configuration and the tendency toward narrowing of the median contact of the first pair of parietals, but A. gonavensis has a short  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  and correspondingly low caudal annular counts (10- <span style="color: green;">13</span> )| it also has low “difference counts” (-2-2), which do not overlap with those of A. caudalis (Gans and Alexander 1962). Amphisbaena caudalis differs from the widespread A. innocens in being more slender (Fig. 3B in THOMAS & HEDGES 2006), having a smaller head (Fig. 3C), a strong mode of 4 scales in the second row of postgenials (vs. a strong mode of 5 in A. innocens) a shorter first infralabial (Fig. 3D), a longer  <span style="color: red;">tail</span> (Fig. 3A), higher caudal annular counts ( <span style="color: green;">17-21</span>  vs. 9-15), caudal autotomy, greater “difference counts” of  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  proportionately larger (longer) posterior  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  less difference in the length of the annular segments between dorsum and venter, and in proportionately larger hemipenes ornamented with larger pleats.

Amphisbaena cegei	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	DIAGNOSIS: A small form of Amphisbaena, without major fusion of head shields, with the frontals, the largest segment on the dorsal surface, and the second infralabial, by far the largest segment on the ventral surface, with a short prognathous snout, a postmental with a medial groove, lacking a postmalar row. The form has  <span style="color: red;">198 body annuli</span>  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: green;">22</span>  caudal annuli</span>  a clearly marked autotomy annulus that falls on the seventh postcloacal annulus, <span style="color: red;">21 to  <span style="color: green;">22</span>  dorsal segments</span>  and  <span style="color: green;">22</span>  to 23 ventral segments to a midbody annulus, and  <span style="color: red;">four precloacal pores</span>  very slightly marked on the holotype. Tail base depressed| behind the autotomy annulus it becomes compressed. Tail tip conical. On the anterior third of the body dorsal pigmentation is light brown| posteriorly it becomes dark brown. On the ventral side, it is very light, but the segments are slightly pigmented, with the pigment more concentrated on the anterior part of the scale. (Montero et al. 1997)IDENTIFICATION. Among the species with  <span style="color: red;">four precloacal pores</span>  Amphisbaena cegei is unique by having a high number of segments to a midbody annulus (44). Amphisbaena cegei differs from A. darwini (with the same number of precloacal pores and similar number of body annuli) by the higher number of segments to a midbody annulus (although A. d. trachura, from Brazil, has 14-21/ 17-23) and by the absence of postmalar row. From A. prunicolor (with which it shares a similar number of precloacal pores, similar number of body annuli, and the absence of postmalar row) Amphisbaena cegei differs by the elevated number of segments to a midbody annulus and different segmental pigmentation. Among the species with a similar number of segments to a midbody annulus, Amphisbaena cegei is distinguished from A. angustifrons by the shape of the snout, by the high number of caudal annuli and by having three (instead of four) supralabial shields. From A. vermicularis, A. petrei, and A. mertensi it differs by the low number of body annuli (Montero et al. 1997).<br>

Amphisbaena darwinii	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	DESCRIPTION: This form of Amphisbaena is medium-sized, in life brownish violet dorsally and pinkish white ventrally, these colors fading to brown dorsally and off-white ventrally in preservatives. The color is expressed evenly across the dorsal segments, with occasional and faint pigment emphasis along the anterior edge or, rarely, in the center of segments. The anterior pigment emphasis (edge marking) is particularly noticeable on the sides of the trunk and on the ventral surface where the edge marking drops out by segments. The lateral countershading, in contrast, occurs by an irregular lightening of pigment area and pigment density. The dorsal surfaces of the  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  and  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  are emphasized by darker, more dense pigmentation. The chin is light, and the light coloration extends across the infralabials onto the mental and rostral, and posteriorly to the cloaca. The third infralabial is often more darkly pigmented, and there may be a ventrad extension of the darker dorsal coloration in the nuchal region. The zone dorsola teral and posterior to the cloaca generally has faint indications of central pigment emphasis. A light, even color extends across the ventral surface of the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  generally starting at the second postcloacal annulus| the autotomy annulus is only rarely and slightly emphasized by darker pigmentation. The  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  segmentation is characterized by lack of major fusions and by a pair of extremely large, roughly trapezoidal prefront als, followed by small triangular frontals, their posterior edges irregularly rounded or scalloped. The  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  is slightly flattened dorsoventrally and generally of oval cross-section with a variably downcurving rostral tip. The angle subtended by the sides of the face increases with age, i.e., with emphasis of the  <span style="color: red;">temporal</span>  musculature. These muscle masses lying over the  <span style="color: red;">temporal</span>  region are faintly apparent externally. The trunk nar rows slightly just posterior to the  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  and becomes much wider thereafter. It reaches its full width near the level of the twentieth body annulus. The rostral is slightly larger than the first supralabial. From above it is visible only as a small triangle. It occupies a slightly longer segment of the labial edge than does the mental. Pairs of medium-sized nasals, very large prefrontals, and smaller frontals form a sequence of enlarged segments along the dorsal surface of the  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  The posterior edge of the frontals extends to a level that corresponds to the middle or posterior edge of the third supralabial. The parietal region is covered by irregularly subdivided segments. These are often not rectangular, but are in variably significantly smaller than the frontal. The angulus oris is often poorly defined. Minor asymmetries in labial size (and hence in labial numbers) are common. There are three supralabials, the second of these some what larger than the first and third. The first postsupralabial is very short and approximately the height of the third supralabial. The first, second, and third interlabial sutures run anterodorsally at angles of 20 degrees, 40 degrees, and 50 degrees (and the suture be tween the third supralabial and the post-supralabial runs at an angle of 30°) to the labial edge. The ocular is more or less quadrangular and is in contact with the second and third supralabials. Dorsally it is in broad contact with the prefrontal and may be in point contact with the frontal. Posteriorly it is followed by the dorsalmost (postocular) segment of the first intercalated dorsal half annulus, though the next ( <span style="color: red;">temporal</span> ) segment ventral to this may achieve point, and occasionally wider, contact. The eye is large, clearly apparent, and situated in the anterior half of the ocular. The snout is slightly prognathous, and the shallow lower jaw is inserted within it. Its anterior tip corresponds to the level of the nostril. The mental is medium-sized and flanked on each side by relatively small first infralabials| its posteriorly convex tip inserts into the anterior aspect of the shield-shaped postmental. The first infralabials are in broad contact with the anterolateral tips of the postmental| the large second infralabials maintain twice as long contact with its sides. The third infralabials are generally twice as long as wide, wider anteriorly, where they are in contact with the malars, than posteriorly, where they often extend caudally slightly be yond the angulus oris. The malars are large and subtriangular| their anteromedial tips are in point contact or excluded from contact with the postmental| in one specimen these tips were divided off by a suture. The post genial region is confused. There are two to four first postgenials, the lateralmost generally enlarged, anteriorly triangular, and en closing the posteriorly pointed tip of the postmental between them. Often there is a slightly smaller, azygous segment in medial contact with the posterior tip of the post mental. The three to six, generally five, irregularly shaped segments of the second post genial row include two wedge-shaped ones that appear to have been divided from the posteromedial edges of the malars. The row curves caudad and may be interrupted on the midline by the medial segment of the first postgenial row. The postmalar row forms a double curve and is composed of eight to 12, generally nine or 10, segments of irregular size. The confusing location of the angulus oris in some cases yields the impression that the postmalar row is absent. Dorsally the first body annulus sweeps anteriorly. It divides near the level of the angulus oris to produce a first intercalated dorsal half-annulus that includes the temporals and postoculars. The first body annu lus continues dorsad to include the (parietal) segments that surround the posterior aspects of the frontals. In a few specimens there is a secondary division into a partial or complete dorsal half-annulus, intercalated between first and second body (in some cases third and fourth) annuli and often fusing with them asymmetrically. The following annuli lose their anterior inclination by the suture posterior to the fourth, which lies in a plane normal to the long axis of the animal. The first eight annuli appear narrowed and separated by markedly wider folding lines that often give them and the one or two posterior ones a shortened and more convexly curved appear ance after preservation. Their midventral segments are markedly reduced, and consid erable irregularity is common in this region. The remaining annuli lie in planes more or less normal to the long axis of the trunk, though some anterior ones may show some degree of posteriorly concave curvature in dorsal view. There are 178 to 199 (sample means, 179.5 to 195.2) <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  from the level of the angulus oris to that including the pore-bearing precloacals. Irregularities in the alignment of annuli are relatively common along the trunk. There are 13 to 18 dorsal and 16.5 to 22 modal numbers of ventral segments to a midbody annulus. The variation here is quite marked, and differences of one to three occur between adjacent annuli. Even large specimens lack diagonal folding lines. The cloacal region is characterized by two to five (almost invariably four) precloacal pores or pore scars. When fully expressed in mature males, the pore cores have a diameter less than one-sixth (rarely one-fourth) of the length of the pore-bearing segments. The lateral ones may be smaller than the medial ones, and some pore scars may lack cores. There are six to eight (generally six) more or less subequal segments in the short, segment shaped precloacal shield. Intersegmental sutures may run in parallel or radiate in a fan-shaped pattern, and the medial or later almost (of the series of six) may be the largest. The postcloacals number nine to 15 (gen erally 10 to 12), and their median pair is the largest. The cloacal region corresponds to three or four, generally three and rarely and asymmetrically two, lateral annuli. It is followed by six to eight  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  equiva lent in length to the  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  which run up to and include the autotomy annulus. Thereafter the remaining annuli of the total series of 18 to 23 caudals become significantly longer. The autotomy annulus is character ized by being narrower and marking a discontinuity in the caudal proportions. One quarter of the specimens had their tails broken at this point. The ventral surface of the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  is flattened| the section beyond the autotomy level may have a ventral crease. A similar dorsal folding line is shown from the level of the cloaca, up to and slightly beyond the autotomy annulus in slightly shrunken specimens, but is indicated only by inter segmental suture alignment. At its base the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  is wider than high| the part beyond the autotomy annulus is swollen in all dimensions and vertically rather than horizontally oval. The dorsal tip bears a trace of a vertical keel. The lateral sulci are clearly marked begin ning at the level of the twentieth to thirty fifth body annulus and continuing to that of the cloaca. They are approximately as wide as a bordering segment and filled with irregularly shaped segmental fragments. There is neither a dorsal nor a ventral sulcus, though the midventral intersegmental sutures are aligned. The middorsal segments are approximately one and one-half times as long as wide| the midventral ones are from one and one-quarter to two times as wide as long. Though considerable proportional variability exists, the medial segments are generally the widest, both dorsally and ventrally.

Amphisbaena leucocephala	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	DIAGNOSIS: A  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">large</span> </span> </span> -sized species of Amphisbaena, <span style="color: green;">without major fusions</span>  of  <span style="color: red;">head shields</span> | with a  <span style="color: green;">rounded</span>  <span style="color: red;">snout</span>  on a relatively blunt head that continues into the  <span style="color: red;">trunk</span>  without nuchal constriction or posterior widening| and with  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">large</span> </span> </span>  <span style="color: red;">parietals</span>  equalling the  <span style="color: red;">frontals</span>  in  <span style="color: red;">size</span>  The form has 233 to 240  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span> | 26 to 27  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  the last two poorly inscribed, and the terminal ones with the segments swollen. The sixth caudal annulus narrows sharply into an autotomy constriction. A midbody annulus has 18 to 20 dorsal and 21 to 22  <span style="color: green;">ventral</span>  segments. The precloacal row bears  <span style="color: green;">12</span>  <span style="color: green;">small</span>  round pores. Only the lateral sulci are strongly indicated. Specimens are brown dorsally and  <span style="color: green;">lighter</span>  ventrally, the brown color proceeding to the end of the sixth body annulus, so that the head and neck are light colored. The  <span style="color: green;">ventral</span>  <span style="color: red;">countershading</span>  occurs more or less gradually along the sides, close to the lateral sulcus. There is some tendency for central pigment accentuation on dorsal segments and dropping out of pigment by segments. (Gans 1965).DESCRIPTION: The following description rests primarily on the type as the DZ specimen was not at hand when this was written. Figure  <span style="color: green;">12</span>  shows dorsal, lateral and  <span style="color: green;">ventral</span>  views of the head, Figure 13, dorsal and  <span style="color: green;">ventral</span>  views at midbody to indicate segment proportions, and Figure 14 a  <span style="color: green;">ventral</span>  view of cloaca and tail to characterize appearance of the pore row and the  <span style="color: red;">autotomy site</span>  Figure 2 graphs meristic characters in comparison with those of A. pretrei, and Figure 3 shows body proportions. The meristic data are given in Table 1. This is a  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">large</span> </span> </span> -sized species of Amphisbaena of uniform  <span style="color: green;">dark brown</span>  dorsal and  <span style="color: green;">lighter</span>  <span style="color: green;">ventral</span>  coloration. The dorsal darkening is achieved by a more or less uniform pigmentation of the entire segment, though the fading seems to be accentuated near the segment margins and along the intersegmental raphes and interannular sutures so that the segment centers appear darker. The head anterior to the fifth body annulus and the distal tip of the tail are completely unpigmented. The  <span style="color: green;">ventral</span>  <span style="color: red;">countershading</span>  seems to occur by a dropping out of pigmentation at or near the lateral sulcus| it is not clear whether this occurs by segmental dropouts or by rapid fading. The autotomy annulus shows  <span style="color: green;">no special pigmentation</span>  The head segmentation shows no major fusions. It is characterized by the enormous prefrontals and by an  <span style="color: green;">asymmetrical</span>  pair of  <span style="color: red;">parietals</span>  averaging to a  <span style="color: red;">size</span>  equal to that of the  <span style="color: red;">frontals</span>  The  <span style="color: red;">snout</span>  is relatively blunt and high, but slopes from the level of the parietal to that of the  <span style="color: red;">nasals</span>  Temporal bulges are noticeable but not marked. The nuchal constriction is faint and the  <span style="color: red;">trunk</span>  diameter changes only gradually. The  <span style="color: red;">trunk</span>  is  <span style="color: green;">oval in cross section</span>  and shows some vertical compression. The rostral is somewhat larger than the first supralabial and almost invisible in dorsal view. Pairs of  <span style="color: green;">rectangular</span>  <span style="color: red;">nasals</span>  wide prefrontals more than twice their  <span style="color: red;">size</span>  smaller pentagonal  <span style="color: red;">frontals</span>  and first  <span style="color: red;">parietals</span>  equal to these follow in sequence, as may  <span style="color: green;">small</span>  second (and smaller third) <span style="color: red;">parietals</span>  The posterior edge of the  <span style="color: red;">frontals</span>  lies along the first portion of the first supralabial, somewhat anterior to the angulus oris. There are  <span style="color: green;">three</span>  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span>  the first the smallest, the second the largest. The  <span style="color: green;">small</span>  and irregularly shaped  <span style="color: red;">postsupralabial</span>  is approximately one-third the  <span style="color: red;">size</span>  of the third supralabial. The supralabial sutures run between 450 and 750 anteriorly to the edge of the mouth, except for the posterior edge of the third which curves broadly caudad. The ocular is diamond-shaped, the eye relatively  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">large</span> </span> </span>  The mental roughly corresponds to the rostral in extent along the labial edge. It is somewhat larger than the first supralabial and its central process forms a  <span style="color: green;">broad</span>  straight raphe with the much larger  <span style="color: red;">postmental</span>  Laterally the  <span style="color: red;">postmental</span>  is in contact with the  <span style="color: green;">small</span>  first and very  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">large</span> </span> </span>  second  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span>  and with the tips of the  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">large</span> </span> </span>  <span style="color: red;">malars</span>  whose lateral extremities reach the elongate third  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span>  The posterior edge of the  <span style="color: red;">postmental</span>  is enclosed between a pair of dropshaped segments of the first postgenial row. The second postgenial row consists of five segments, the median and lateral ones being wedge-shaped and inserting some slight distance between the segments of the first row. The posterior tips of the elongate third  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span>  enclose the  <span style="color: green;">ventral</span>  part of the first body annulus| nine segments, the lateralmost the widest, lie in the position of postmalars. Dorsally this annulus comprises the postsupralabials, and a very  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">large</span> </span> </span>  temporal and a  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">large</span> </span> </span>  postocular that contact the lateral edges of the  <span style="color: red;">frontals</span>  and (asymmetrically) the  <span style="color: red;">parietals</span>  The second body annulus splits dorsally to form a dorsal intercalated half-annulus, all of the segments of this area being enlarged, irregular, and variously polygonal. There are 233 to 240  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  from the back of the third  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span>  up to and including the pore-bearing precloacals. The  <span style="color: green;">ventral</span>  portions of the second through seventh annuli show some complexing and are composed of  <span style="color: green;">rounded</span>  rather than  <span style="color: green;">rectangular</span>  segments. The third through ninth annuli are narrower on their lateral and dorsal aspects than are the following ones and the interannular raphes appear capable of greater bending in that they are wide and filled with tiny fragments. The annular pattern is regular along the  <span style="color: red;">trunk</span>  and the only modification occurs in the cloacal region. There are 18 to 20 dorsal and 21 to '22  <span style="color: green;">ventral</span>  segments to a midbody annulus, with considerable irregularity even between adjacent segments. There is a row of  <span style="color: green;">12</span>  <span style="color: green;">small</span>  but clearly marked, round  <span style="color: red;">precloacal pores</span>  in the male holotype and in the unsexed DZ specimen. Eight to ten segments form the shallow, segment-shaped precloacal shield, and 14 to 18  <span style="color: green;">small</span>  postcloacals fringe the posterior edge. There are four lateral and six  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  up to and including the markedly narrowed autotomy annulus. <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  number 26 to 27, the last  <span style="color: green;">three</span>  indicated only by very shallow raphes and represented as inscribed markings on the bluntly ridged caudal tip. Most of the dorsal and lateral segments on the tip appear faintly convex. The tail is bluntly oval at its base, swells laterally beyond the autotomy constriction, and then shows some faint lateral compression toward the distal tip. The lateral sulci are clearly marked after the 45th body annulus| at midbody they are about as wide as a fringing segment and filled with several kinds o'f irregular segments. Dorsal and  <span style="color: green;">ventral</span>  sulci are poorly indicated by alignment of intersegmental raphes. The middorsal segments are approximately 1.5 times as long as wide, the midventral segments about 1.4 times as wide as long, with some segment variability along the  <span style="color: red;">trunk</span> (Gans 1965).<br>

Amphisbaena medemi	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	DIAGNOSIS: A small to medium-sized form of Amphisbaena with the  <span style="color: red;">nasals</span>  totally separated or  <span style="color: green;">reduced to medial point contact</span>  by the  <span style="color: red;">ascending rostral</span>  which  <span style="color: green;">generally contacts the frontals</span>  Specimens often have  <span style="color: green;">azygous fusion</span>  of  <span style="color: red;">postocular and parietal head scales</span> | <span style="color: green;">three equally sized</span>  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span> | one medium, one large, and one small infralabial on each side| <span style="color: green;">two</span>  postgenial and no postmalar rows of chin shields. There are  <span style="color: green;">230-235</span>  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span> | <span style="color: green;">17- <span style="color: green;">18</span> </span>  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  with the  <span style="color: red;">autotomy constriction</span>  falling on the  <span style="color: green;">fifth to seventh postcloacal annulus</span> | <span style="color: green;">16</span>  dorsal and  <span style="color: green;">18</span>  ventral segments per midbody annulus| and four large circular  <span style="color: red;">precloacal pores</span>  in both sexes. The specimens are brown dorsally, fading to a lighter color ventrally. The color is densest in the rectangular centers of each segment, with the dark area decreasing along the sides and dropping out by segments in the neck and caudal regions. Many specimens show a light nuchal band (Gans & Mathers 1967).DESCRIPTION: Figures 2 through 7 show aspects of segmentation, pigmentation and body proportions. Figure 8 presents a scatter diagram of tail lengths versus snout-vent lengths. The raw data for the type series are given in Table 1. This is a small to medium-sized species of Amphisbaena, showing a brownish dorsal and a lighter ventral coloration. The tip of the snout and the nuchal region tend to be lightened, while the dorsal, lateral, and posterior surfaces of the tail are densely pigmented. The lateral limits of pigmentation extend onto the ventral surface of the tail so that only the medial  <span style="color: green;">two</span>  to four rows of segments are lightened. The intersegmental and interannular sutures are always lighter than the scale centers. Rostral, <span style="color: red;">nasals</span>  and superlabials as well as the chin shields tend to be unpigmented. <span style="color: green;">two</span>  or three annuli between the second and seventh may be faded or may lack pigmentation producing a light band across the nuchal region. The dorsal surface is more or less uniformly pigmented with only slight emphasis of the segmental centers. The  <span style="color: green;">two</span>  middorsal rows of segments are significantly darkened. One or  <span style="color: green;">two</span>  rows below the lateral sulcus the pigmentation becomes restricted to the segmental centers and these may become very small and faint by the fifth or sixth ventral row from each side. The three or four annuli anterior to the cloaca and the midventral segments of the  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  show checkerboarding with the pigmentation appearing to drop sharply and often asymmetrically on individual segments. The head segmentation is characterized by a caudad projection of the dorsal tip of the rostral which partially or totally separates the  <span style="color: red;">nasals</span>  from medial contact and in some specimens inserts briefly between the pref rentals, and by the generally  <span style="color: green;">azygous fusion</span>  of parietal and postocular head scales| yet lacks other major fusions. The head is dorsoventrally compressed| the slightly elongated snout is dorsally arched but is of a horizontally oval cross-section. The rostral tip extends beyond the lower jaw and the temporal bulges noticeably posterior to the eye. There is some indication of nuchal constriction and slight reduction of the diameter of the nuchal region. The trunk is approximately the same diameter along its length and is compressed dorso-ventrally representing at midbody a horizontally oval cross-section. The rostral is visible from above, slightly larger than the first supralabial, and of the same area as the  <span style="color: red;">nasals</span>  Pairs of separated  <span style="color: red;">nasals</span>  large prefrontals, medium-sized frontals, and smaller, quadrangular to pentagonal parietals form a sequence along the dorsal surface of the head. The posterior tips of the frontals insert along the anterior suture between the parietals. Only four specimens have discrete parietals, in six that of the right side is fused to the enlarged postocular, in one fusion is on the left side and  <span style="color: green;">two</span>  show both sides fused. The diamond-shaped oculars are in anterior contact with the third  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span>  and the large postocular. Each of three subequal  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span>  is slightly larger than the ocular. The postsupralabial (just posterior to the angulus oris) abuts dorsally on the very large first temporal (which may be in point contact with the ocular). The postsupralabials, temporals, postoculars, and frontals apparently comprise the dorsal segments of the first body annulus. The four middorsal segments of the second body annulus are irregularly enlarged and lie posterior to the parietals, which thus seem to represent a medially intercalated pair of segments. The eye is clearly apparent. The mental is slightly narrower than the rostral, its area equivalent to that of the first  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span>  which are followed by large sec ond  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span>  and smaller rectangular third  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span>  The ovate, posteriorly triangular postmental is in straight contact with the mental, in broad contact with the first and second  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span>  flanked by the elongate elements of the first, and in narrow contact with the central element of the second postgenial row. The malars are roughly as wide as long, in medial contact with the third  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span>  and broadly contact the second  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span>  The malars flank the  <span style="color: green;">two</span>  rows of postgenials, the interrupted first containing  <span style="color: green;">two</span>  and the second containing  <span style="color: green;">three to five</span>  segments. The second row of postgenials tends to be irregular and its segments may fuse with those of the first body annulus. There is no postmalar row, nor are the immediate postmalar segments enlarged by fusion. Dorsally the first body annulus includes one to  <span style="color: green;">two</span>  small segments posterior to the third supralabial, the temporal, the postocular, and the frontals. The dorsal segments of the nuchal region are enlarged and the corresponding ventral segments reduced. The dorsal segments along the trunk consistently decrease slightly in size from the nuchal region towards the cloacal zone and onto the tail. There are  <span style="color: green;">230-235</span>  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  from the back of the third infralabial up to and including the pore-bearing precloacal. Irregularity of the segmentation or dorsal half-annuli are rare. A midbody annulus contains 14 to  <span style="color: green;">16</span> (generally  <span style="color: green;">16</span> ) dorsal and  <span style="color: green;">16</span>  to  <span style="color: green;">18</span> (generally  <span style="color: green;">18</span> ) ventral segments. The cloacal region is characterized by  <span style="color: green;">four large, circular</span>  <span style="color: red;">precloacal pores</span>  six to eight precloacal segments, 12 to 17  <span style="color: red;">postcloacal segments</span>  and  <span style="color: green;">three to five</span>  <span style="color: red;">lateral rows</span>  There are 17 to  <span style="color: green;">18</span>  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  up to the smooth caudal cap, with the autotomy annulus falling on the  <span style="color: green;">fifth to seventh postcloacal annulus</span>  No specimens show autotomized tails or healed scars. Segments bearing rectangularly pigmented centers extend further ventrally on the autotomy annulus than on other  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  The tail is horizontally oval in section at its base, then reaches a  <span style="color: green;">vertically oval section</span>  with an indented ventral surface in the terminal third. For the last three annuli it shows a sharp bilateral flattening so that it terminates in a blunt vertical keel. The  <span style="color: red;">lateral sulci</span>  begin after approximately the 45th body annulus and continue up to the level of the cloaca. These sulci are  <span style="color: green;">poorly defined and narrower than one bordering segment</span>  There is no obvious dorsal sulcus. <span style="color: red;">lateral and ventral sulcal regions</span>  are characterized by  <span style="color: green;">slight indentations of the trunk</span>   The middorsal segments of the midbody annulus are approximately  <span style="color: green;">two</span>  times as long as wide. The ventral segments are approximately IVa times as wide as long (Gans & Mathers 1967).<br>

Amphisbaena myersi	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	DIAGNOSIS: A  <span style="color: green;">small</span>  amphisbaenid with a relatively long tail. <span style="color: red;">number of body annuli</span>  <span style="color: green;">221 (+1+1/2)</span>  tail annuli  <span style="color: green;">27 +1</span>  <span style="color: red;">scales around midbody</span>  <span style="color: green;">16 + 16</span> | three supralabials| three infralabials| <span style="color: red;">supraocular</span>  <span style="color: green;">small</span> | <span style="color: red;">preanal pores</span>  <span style="color: green;">four</span>  a  <span style="color: green;">distinct</span>  <span style="color: red;">autotomy constriction</span>  ate the eighth caudal annulus. Head above and below creamish| dorsal surface of tail and back brown| ventral parts creamish| at middle of tail an irregular creamish crossband (Hoogmoed 1989).DESCRIPTION: Head as wide as the body, not depressed| posterior part with a slight, but  <span style="color: green;">distinct</span>  Median dorsal sulcus. Snout rounded, blunt, swollen, strongly projecting over the mouth. Rostral  <span style="color: green;">small</span>  pentagonal, wider than deep, not visible from above. Three supralabials, the anterior one trapezoid| the second one irregularly pentagonal, subequal to the first| the posterior one much smaller than the preceding two, rectangular, in broad contact with the ocular. Ocular  <span style="color: green;">small</span>  trapezoid, in contact with second and third supralabials, first postocular and preocular| narrowly separated from frontal and temporal. Two large postoculars behind each other, the second one not in contact with the ocular| first quadrangular to irregularly pentagonal, larger than ocular| second irregularly pentagonal, on the left hand side subequal to the ocular, on the right hand side distinctly larger than the first  <span style="color: red;">supraocular</span>  This difference in size is caused by irregularities in scale formation in the parietal region, as shown by left parietal that has incomplete sutures whereas on the right hand side it looks like the lateral part of the parietal has merged with the second  <span style="color: red;">supraocular</span>  thus causing a large shield to arise. A single, pentagonal or hexagonal temporal, subequal to the ocular. Below temporal a  <span style="color: green;">small</span>  quadrangular postsupralabial. A pair of large, quadrangular nasals in broad contact. A pair of smaller rectangular prefrontals, wider than long. A pair of nearly semicircular frontals, smaller than the prefrontals. Frontal suture longer than nasal suture, which in turn is longer than the prefrontal suture. A pair of pentagonal (left) or quadrangular (right) parietals, as large as, or smaller than the frontal. Some fusion seems to occur here.Mental large, more or less rectangular, with rounded hind margin and anteriorly diverging sides, much longer than wide. Three infralabials, the first more or less trapezoid| the second much larger, pentagonal| the third  <span style="color: green;">small</span>  quadrangular. Postmental large, pentagonal, about as long as wide, distinctly separated from the large malars| followed by a first row of two elongate, trapezoid postgenials and a second row of  <span style="color: green;">four</span> (central two largest) postgenials. A row of postmalars of which the outermost one on each side is much larger than the central five. Throat with transverse rows of quadrangular scales which are smaller than the ventrals.Scales on nape and side of neck similar to the dorsals, but more quadrangular and with rounded corners.Dorsals  <span style="color: green;">small</span>  rectangular with right angles, longer than wide| 16 in an annulus at midbody level. Median ventrals larger than the dorsals, quadrangular to rectangular (wider than long)| towards the sides ventrals smaller, as large as the dorsals, longer than wide| 16 in an annulus at midbody level. Total number of  <span style="color: red;">scales around midbody</span>  32. A lateral sulcus separating the dorsals and the ventrals. Scales bordering on the sulcus have rounded lateral margins, the space between dorsal and ventral part of an annulus is filled by two  <span style="color: green;">small</span>  oval scales. No dorsal or ventral sulcus.After the eighth dorsal annulus there is an intercalated incomplete annulus showing a gap of three scales on the belly| three annuli before the pore-bearing annulus there is an intercalated dorsal (half) annulus| 221 complete, one incomplete and one half annuli from the back of the postsupralabial to and including the preanal pore-bearing annulus| <span style="color: green;">four</span>  lateral annuli in the cloacal region. <span style="color: red;">preanal pores</span>  <span style="color: green;">four</span>  transversely oval| posterior part of pore-bearing scales, which are longer than wide, divided into smaller scales| seven preanal segments| postanal segments not  <span style="color: green;">distinct</span> Caudal annuli (counting from the first complete postanal annulus) 27 and a divided endplate. The eighth caudal annulus consists of scales dis- tinctly smaller than those of the preceeding and following annuli, marking a slight  <span style="color: red;">autotomy constriction</span>  Tip of tail bluntly rounded, slightly compressed in a vertical plane. (Hoogmoed 1989).Colour in life: unknown. (Hoogmoed 1989).Colour in preservative: the dorsal and ventral aspects of the head, the neck, the belly and the ventral surface of the tail are creamish, immaculate. Starting with the fifth body annulus, the dorsal scales show a dark pigmentation, increasing in intensity and area occupied posteriorly. Thus, the anterior part of the back is light brown, the posterior part of the back, and the dorsal surface of most of the tail are dark brown. All dorsal scales and the two outermost ventral scales on each side in an annulus are brown. From caudal annulus 7 to 17 there is a wide, transverse, creamish band on the dorsal part of the tail. The creamish area being invaded by some brown scales, whereas in adjacent brown annuli some white scales are present. This light band is not caused by damage to the skin, but is due to the absence of pigmentation in the scales concerned. (Hoogmoed 1989).Size: A  <span style="color: green;">small</span>  species with a slender, cylindrical body and a moderately long (about 1/8 of snout-vent length), cylindrical tail with bluntly rounded tip. Snout-vent length 188 mm, tail length 25 mm (Hoogmoed 1989).<br>

Amphisbaena neglecta	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Diagnosis: A form of Amphisbaena with the  <span style="color: red;">postrostral head shield</span>  <span style="color: green;">paired</span>  the  <span style="color: red;">midventral segments</span>  of each annulus  <span style="color: green;">broadened</span>  to twice their length and with a  <span style="color: green;">single pair</span>  of round  <span style="color: red;">precloacal pores</span>  Specimens have 151 to 161  <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : red;">body annuli</span> | 20 to 21  <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : red;">caudal annuli</span> | an  <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : red;">autotomy constriction</span>  at the  <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : green;">4th to 6th postcloacal annulus</span> | 12 to 14 dorsal and 12 to 14  <span style="color: red;">ventral segments</span>  to a midbody annulus| and 4 to 6  <span style="color: red;">precloacal segments</span>  The  <span style="color: red;">color</span>  is  <span style="color: green;">dark brown</span>  dorsally fading  <span style="color: green;">slightly toward the ventral surface</span>  On the sides each segment begins to be bordered by a  <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : green;">lighter edge</span>  which is most marked ventrally. The dark  <span style="color: red;">color</span>  drops out by segments along the  <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : red;">chin</span>  <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : red;">cloacal region</span>  and the  <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : red;">anterior portion of the ventral surface</span> (Gans 1962).Notes on the types. The holotype shows the least fading of the  <span style="color: red;">color</span>  pattern. It is quite soft along the precloacal part of the body as are the paratypes. Several of the tails have been slit in someone's futile attempt at sexing and all of the lower jaws have been broken. Amphisbaenid, snake, and many lizard skulls may be extracted through a midventral incision, without damage to either skin or skull. The extraction of single elements or breaking of the jaws provides a minimum of information for a maximum of damage and should never be practiced on rare or unique specimens, if at all (Gans 1962).Description: Meristic characters are summarized in Table 1. Figure 4 shows views of the head, Figure 6 of the cloaca and tail, and Figure 8 photographs of the  <span style="color: red;">color</span>  pattern. The  <span style="color: red;">type series</span>  is a  <span style="color: green;">light brown dorsally</span>  fading slightly toward the sides of the body. The  <span style="color: red;">segmental margins</span>  and  <span style="color: red;">intersegmental raphes</span>  of the back are  <span style="color: green;">insignificantly lighter</span>  so that the impression is one of continuous tone. The  <span style="color: red;">color</span>  is  <span style="color: green;">densest</span>  on the  <span style="color: red;">dorsal surfaces</span>  of the head and tail. The  <span style="color: red;">segmental margins</span>  are  <span style="color: green;">significantly lighter on the ventral surface</span>  The  <span style="color: red;">tip</span>  the  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span>  the  <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : red;">chin</span>  region and the anterior quarter of the ventral surface are  <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : green;"> <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : green;"> <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : green;"> <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : green;"> <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">bleached</span> </span> </span> </span> </span> </span>  with the  <span style="color: red;">color</span>  coming in by segments from the sides and the rear. There seems to be some individual variation with ANSP 13019 completely dark after the first third, as in ANSP 13022| ANSP 13021 has no bleaching caudad of the first quarter, though ANSP 13020 has three distinct areas of bleaching prior to the cloaca. The  <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : red;">cloacal region</span>  is entirely dark in ANSP 13021, has the left segment of the midventral pair  <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : green;"> <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : green;"> <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : green;"> <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : green;"> <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">bleached</span> </span> </span> </span> </span> </span>  in ANSP 13019 and 13022, and all preand one postcloacal segment  <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : green;"> <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : green;"> <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : green;"> <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : green;"> <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">bleached</span> </span> </span> </span> </span> </span>  in ANSP 13020. The Annapolis specimen has a light streak down the entire ventral surface with only occasional dark segments. It also differs by a light nuchal band made up of the sixth and some segments of the seventh  <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : red;">body annuli</span>  The head scalation is characterized by a lack of major fusions. The first two  <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : red;">body annuli</span>  correspond to two dorsal half-annuli. The segments of the first are commonly referred to as temporal and postocular and abut middorsally on the frontals. The second body annulus culminates dorsally in the pair of enlarged parietals. The third annulus ascends in a plane normal to the long axis and is only differentiated by a wider than normal pair of middorsal segments. ANSP 13022 shows a posterior extension (by fusion) of the last labials beyond the angulus oris. ANSP 13021 has some asymmetric fusions in the parietal regions. The  <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : red;">chin</span>  is characterized by a small symphysial, very large second infralabials, large first malars, a of anteriorly pair pointed postgenials, and a variable number of second postgenials filling the gaps along the posterior edge of the first row. There is no row, but the segments immediately posterior to the malars are fused. postmalar The second, third, fourth, fifth, and sometimes the sixth  <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : red;">body annuli</span>  are slightly narcentral and two small lateral segments, exceptinANSP13021wherethereareonl rowed. Asymmetries are few and restricted to the midventral line and the level of the cloaca. The numbers of dorsal and ventral half-annuli are equal. The lateral sulci are clearly marked from four lengths behind the head to the cloaca. The dorsal and ventral sulci are indicated only by aligned raphes, with the ventral sulcus a common site of folding. The cloaca is preceded by four large four (possibly five). The  <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : red;">autotomy constriction</span>  is expressed by a narrowed annulus of reduced diameter, posterior to which autotomy has taken place in AMNH 62155. The middorsal segments are slightly longer than wide, those along the midventral line two to three times as wide as long, with considerable change from front to rear (Gans 1962).<br>

Amphisbaena nigricauda	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	DIAGNOSIS: This is a small species of Amphisbaena, without major fusions of head shields, with the  <span style="color: red;">prefrontal</span>  the  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">largest segment</span> </span>  on the dorsal, and the  <span style="color: red;">second infralabial</span>  by far the  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">largest segment</span> </span>  on the ventral, surface of the head, with a strongly prognathous snout on the small head, enlarged postocular and parietal segments, no post-malar row, and a dark, pigmented, caudal tip. The form has 222 to 226  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  19 to 24  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  a clearly marked  <span style="color: red;">autotomy annulus</span>  that falls on the  <span style="color: green;">sixth to ninth postcloacal annuli</span>  <span style="color: green;">10</span>  dorsal and  <span style="color: green;">16</span>  ventral segments to a midbody annulus, and  <span style="color: green;">four</span>  clearly marked, <span style="color: red;">round pores</span>  in both sexes. The tail is  <span style="color: green;">cylindrical</span>  with a  <span style="color: green;">conical</span>  distal tip. The  <span style="color: red;">coloration</span>  is very  <span style="color: green;">light brownish white</span>  very  <span style="color: green;">slightly darker</span>  on the  <span style="color: red;">dorsal surface</span>  but with the last six to eight  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  <span style="color: green;">much more heavily pigmented</span>  both dorsally and ventrally. The darker pigment is produced by a  <span style="color: green;">speckling</span>  rather than an even  <span style="color: red;">pigmentation</span>  of segments| the individual  <span style="color: red;">melanophores</span>  may be seen under the dissecting microscope.

Amphisbaena occidentalis	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	DESCRIPTION: A  <span style="color: green;">small</span>  species of Amphisbaena with a  <span style="color: green;">dark purplish-brown</span>  dorsal, and  <span style="color: green;">light</span>  ventral coloration. The  <span style="color: red;">dorsal color</span>  is produced by pigmentation of the segments and drops out by segments along the sides (occasionally on the back) producing a characteristic mottled effect. The dorsal surfaces of head and tail are more densely and solidly pigmented than those of the body. The head is  <span style="color: green;">flattened</span>  and there is considerable dorsoventral compression of the  <span style="color: red;">pectoral region</span>  The muscle masses lying over the parietal portion of the skull do not change the outline of the head in large specimens. The rostral is  <span style="color: green;">small</span>  scarcely visible from above. <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">pairs</span> </span> </span>  of  <span style="color: red;">nasals</span>  <span style="color: red;">prefrontals</span>  and  <span style="color: red;">frontals</span>  form a  <span style="color: red;">suture</span>  <span style="color: green;">along the head</span>  with the posterior edge of the  <span style="color: red;">frontals</span>  lying somewhat anterior to the angle of the mouth (for nomenclature see Gans and Alexander, ms.). The  <span style="color: red;">occipitals</span>  are no larger than the  <span style="color: red;">dorsal segments</span>  <span style="color: green;">four</span>  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span>  the second largest. <span style="color: green;">three</span>  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span>  plus a  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">small</span>  fourth scale</span>  that also forms the angle of the gape and projects dorsad around the posterior edge of the last supralabial.  <span style="color: green;">261-79</span>  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  from the back of last infralabial to and including the pore-bearing precloacals. The first  <span style="color: green;">four</span>  to  <span style="color: green;">six</span>  annuli of the  <span style="color: red;">neck region</span>  shorter than  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  Since the posterior edge of the  <span style="color: red;">frontals</span>  lies anterior to the fourth infralabial the annuli curve forward dorsally. This may be compensated for by an elongation of the  <span style="color: red;">dorsal segments</span>  of the 7th to 12th annuli (approximately). These annuli thus appear more or less  <span style="color: green;">v-shaped</span>  in dorsal view. <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">three</span>  to  <span style="color: green;">four</span> </span>  <span style="color: red;">dorsal half annuli</span> (not included in the counts) are generally  <span style="color: green;">present</span>  in this region and there is a tendency toward considerable irregular interdigitation and complexity in the ventral portion of this (the pectoral) region. The  <span style="color: green;">six</span>  <span style="color: red;">precloacal annuli</span>  also tend toward irregularities and asymmetries. <span style="color: red;">segments per midbody annulus</span>  generally 16 or 18 dorsals, 24 or 26 ventrals, 42 or 44 total. <span style="color: red;">ranges</span>  are 16 - 19 dorsals, 22 - 27 ventrals, 38 - 47 totals. Dorsal and ventral folding lines (grooves) are  <span style="color: green;">present</span>  but not differentiated. The lateral lines may be faintly indicated in approximately 50% of the specimens, on others they are only noticeable as aligned intersegmental sutures.There are  <span style="color: green;">four</span>  precloacal pores in all specimens, followed by  <span style="color: green;">six</span>  to nine precloacal segments, of which the central  <span style="color: green;">six</span>  are often large and of equal size. The post-cloacal segments are generally subject to splitting, yielding 11 to 16 very irregular radial segments. The pores of males are large and generally pigmented, those of females smaller, faintly indicated and nonpigmented. No other characters show significant sexual dimorphism (Gans 1961)<br>

Amphisbaena pretrei	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	DIAGNOSIS: A medium- to large-sized form of Amphisbaena, without major fusions of head shields, with a relatively  <span style="color: green;">wide</span>  rounded snout, a head that continues into the trunk without constriction or widening, and with generally some modification of or anterior elongation of the ocular, or splitting off of a part of the lateral edge of the large prefrontal to form one or more small irregular segments. The form has 231 to, 255 body annuli| 22 to 26 caudal annuli, the last of which are poorly inscribed, and the terminal ones have the segments swollen. The fifth, sixth or seventh, generally the sixth, caudal annulus has sharply narrowed into an autotomy constriction at which some specimens have broken tails. Median numbers of segments to a midbody annulus are 20 to'27 for dorsals and 22 to 28 for ventrals. Five to nine, generally six or eight, precloacal pores lie in an uninterrupted series. Only the lateral sulci are strongly indicated. Specimens have a uniform  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">brown</span> </span>  <span style="color: red;">dorsal surface</span>  and a clear  <span style="color: red;">ventral surface</span>  The  <span style="color: red;">pigment</span>  covers the segments evenly, though there is an intra-annular  <span style="color: red;">pigment</span>  density gradient and some  <span style="color: red;">dorsal segments</span>  also  <span style="color: green;">bear a central light spot</span>  The  <span style="color: red;">ventral countershading</span>  <span style="color: green;">occurs more or less gradually along the sides</span>  (Gans 1965)DESCRIPTION: Figure 4 shows dorsal, lateral and ventral views of the head' and Figure 5, ventral view of cloaca and tail. Figures 6 through 11 show various details of two specimens, one of which is the type of subocularis. Figure 2 summarizes geographic variation of meristic characters and Figure 3 compares body proportions with those of A. leucocephala. Meristic data are given in Table 1. This is a medium- to large-sized species of Amphisbaena of uniform dark  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">brown</span> </span>  dorsal and  <span style="color: green;">lighter</span>  ventral coloration. The dorsal darkening is achieved by pigmentation of the entire segment| in preserved specimens the  <span style="color: red;">pigment</span>  is slightly denser toward the anterior segmental margin. Certain  <span style="color: red;">dorsal segments</span>  show traces of a central, circular, light-colored spot. The  <span style="color: red;">ventral countershading</span>  seems to occur by a fading of pigmentation in some segments ventral to the lateral sulcus. The  <span style="color: red;">autotomy annulus</span>  <span style="color: green;">shows no special pigmentation</span>  The  <span style="color: red;">head segmentation</span>  shows  <span style="color: green;">no major fusions</span>  The  <span style="color: red;">rectangular nasals</span>  are very  <span style="color: green;">wide</span>  and the  <span style="color: red;">prefrontals</span>  are the  <span style="color: green;">largest segments on the head</span>  The  <span style="color: red;">parietal region</span>  is  <span style="color: green;">often confused</span> | its often asymmetrical segments vary in size by one power above that normal to  <span style="color: red;">dorsal segments</span>  The head is relatively blunt. The tip is  <span style="color: green;">wide</span>  in dorsal view, while the lateral view shows a significantly deep snout, and the head is almost as tall at the level of the nares as at the eye. Temporal bulges are noticeable, the nuchal constriction limited, and the maximum trunk diameter (attained near the 20th annulus) is but slightly greater than that of the head. The trunk is faintly oval in cross section. The rostral is subequal to the first supralabial, and almost invisible in dorsal view. Pairs of large  <span style="color: red;">rectangular nasals</span>  somewhat larger  <span style="color: red;">prefrontals</span>  and almost triangular frontals follow in sequence along the dorsal midline. In some specimens these are followed by a pair of large parietals, whose area is up to one-half that of the frontals. The posterior edge of the frontals lies midway along the level of the third supralabial, somewhat anterior to the angulus oris. There are three supralabials, the first equal in area to, but of much longer extent along the edge of the mouth than, the second. Both second and third are often split by a suture, parallel with the edge of the mouth, into supralabial and "subocular" (see table). The postsupralabial is approximately half the size of the divided portion of the third supralabial. The supralabial sutures run anteriorly at angles near 450 to the edge of the mouth. The ocular is extremely irregular, its outline varying from diamond-shaped to triangular. The variation primarily affects the anterior portion which encroaches on the area often occupied by the superior portion of the supralabials. The suture junction of the nasal-prefrontal, and of first and second supralabials may be occupied by a small segment or row of segments that may continue along the lateral prefrontal edge to join the anterior wing of the ocular (this condition coded as "Y" in Table 1, and shown in Figure 4). The mental corresponds with the rostral in extent along the edge of the mouth. Centrally it sends back a short, <span style="color: green;">wide</span>  posteriorly convex process that inserts into the anterior aspect of the large, shield-shaped postmental. The latter is also in contact with the small first and much larger second infralabials, and is surrounded posteriorly by a pair of large segments of the first postgenial row, occasionally separated by a small median segment, which excludes the large malars from postmental contact. The second postgenial row has three to six segments, two of which are often sliver-shaped wedges cutting off the medial edges of the malars and extending anteriorly beyond the limits of the other segments. In some specimens, the first postgenials are elongate, occupying the space of both rows, and two or three sliver-shaped segments (their number listed in parentheses in Table 1) wedge between their posterior extremities but do not contact the postmental. The long third infralabials often extend for half their length beyond the angulus oris to interrupt the first body annulus. A row of nine to thirteen segments, of the ventral portion of the first body annulus, lies between their medial edges in the position of a postmalar row. Dorsally the first body annulus swings forward to contact the lateral edges of the frontals back of the oculars. The temporal and postocular segments may be enlarged. The second body annulus includes the parietals and is generally split to form one or two extra dorsal intercalated half-annuli. There are 231 to 255 body annuli from the back of the first supralabial up to and including the pore-bearing precloacals. The ventral portions of the third through seventh annuli show some complexing, and are composed of rounded rather than rectangular segments. The fourth through ninth annuli are narrower on their lateral and dorsal aspects than are the following ones. The annular pattern is regular along the trunk and only shows an occasional modification in the cloacal region. There are 20 to 27 dorsal and 20 to 28 ventral segments to a midbody annulus, with but little alignment of intersegmental raphes. A row of five to nine, generally six or eight, small but clearly apparent, round precloacal pores appears to be present in the cloacal region of both sexes. Eight to 12 segments form the segment-shaped precloacal shield, with at least the central eight generally enlarged. The postcloacals number 13 to 19 tiny segments with only the central pair widened. There are three or, generally, four lateral rows, and five to six, rarely seven, caudal annuli up to and including the markedly narrowed  <span style="color: red;">autotomy annulus</span>  Caudal annuli number 21 to 26 of which the last three (two to four) are separated only by very shallow raphes and represented as poorly inscribed markings on the bluntly ridged caudal tip. The tail is horizontally oval at its base, becomes more vertically oval posterior to the autotomy level, and the  <span style="color: red;">dorsal surface</span>  then curves ventrad so that the distal tip lies below the caudal midline. Some specimens have the last caudal annuli tilted from the vertical to face upward at a slight angle. The lateral sulci are clearly marked after the 40th body annulus| at midbody they are somewhat narrower than a fringing segment, and filled with irregular fragments. Dorsal and ventral sulci are only indicated as alignments of intersegmental raphes without other diversification. The middorsal segments vary from 1.2 to 1.5 times as long as  <span style="color: green;">wide</span>  The midventral segments are about 1.2 times as  <span style="color: green;">wide</span>  as long, but proportions vary considerably along the trunk with the widest segments seemingly near midbody (Gans 1965).<br>

One has 180 annuli on the body, one 181, one 182, three 183, two 185, two 186, one 187, one 188, oue 189, one 190, one 195, and one 196| two have 18 annuli on the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  eleven 19, and three 20. The “Porto-Bello" specimen has 189 annuli on the belly, and 19 on the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  The number of annuli in five specimens of A. caeca (including the type) recorded by Strauch are respectively 212 + 15, 215 + 13, 227 +18, 230 + 16, and 247+15. Duméril and Bibron give 226-329+18. A specimen from Porto Rico, which I owe to the kindness of Prof. Lütken, has 228+19. Considering that the number 247 + 15 given by Strauch is taken from a specimen in the Paris Museum, received from the Copenhagen Museum as from the island of St. Thomas, where only A. fenestrata (Cope) = antillensis, R. & L., is known to occur, as Prof. Lütken kindly informs me, it is clear to me that the specimen with 247 annuli belongs to A. fenestrata. The number of annuli would range, in A. caeca from 212 to 229, and in the present species from 180 to 196. According to Strauch, the length of the labial border of the first labial shield in A. caeca is about one half the length of that of the second| on Peters's figure of the type specimen, as well as in the Porto Rico specimen before me, it is about two thirds in A. Ridleyi both are equal, or the former is a little longer. The  <span style="color: red;">snout</span>  is longer and somewhat more prominent, the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  thicker and more obtuse in A. caca than in A. Ridleyi. The ventral segments of the two median rows are broader than long in the former species, the coloration of which is also different. (Boulenger 1890)<br>

Amphisbaena sanctaeritae	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Diagnosis: Amphisbaena sanctaeritae is distinguished from all the other species of Amphisbaenidae by the following combination of characters: (1) <span style="color: red;">head</span>  <span style="color: green;">round</span>  not depressed but laterally compressed| (2) <span style="color: red;">prefrontal suture</span> <span style="color: green;">≥ frontal suture > nasal suture</span> | (3) <span style="color: red;">four precloacal pores</span>  <span style="color: green;">without a median hiatus</span> | (4) <span style="color: red;">lateral sulcus</span>  <span style="color: green;">present</span> | <span style="color: red;">dorsal and ventral sulci</span>  <span style="color: green;">absent</span> | (5) <span style="color: green;">269–288</span>  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span> | (6) <span style="color: green;">2–3</span>  <span style="color: red;">lateral annuli</span> | (7) <span style="color: green;">18–20</span>  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span> | (8) <span style="color: red;">autotomy</span>  <span style="color: green;">on 6th or 7th caudal annulus, not always perceptible</span> | (9) <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  with  <span style="color: green;">similar width along its length, slightly laterally compressed at distal part</span> | (10) 10 dorsal and 14  <span style="color: red;">ventral segments on midbody annulus</span> | (11) three supralabials| (12) three infralabials| (13) one or two rows of genials| (14) <span style="color: red;">post-malar row</span>  <span style="color: green;">with 7–8 scales</span> | (15) <span style="color: red;">post-ocular</span>  <span style="color: green;">present</span>  but temporal scale  <span style="color: green;">absent</span>  probably fused with third supralabial| (16) a pair of quadrangular or rectangular  <span style="color: red;">parietals</span>  with similar size or little larger than adjacent dorsal segments| (17) dorsum with a cream ground color in preservative (probably pinkish in life), slightly to densely speckled with brown| (18) venter cream colored in preservative, probably pinkish in life.The presence of a  <span style="color: green;">round</span>  <span style="color: red;">head</span> (not shovel or keel-shaped) <span style="color: red;">four precloacal pores</span>  and  <span style="color: green;">269–288</span>  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  readily distinguishes Amphisbaena sanctaeritae from all South American amphisbaenians except the following 11 species: A. arenaria Vanzolini 1991b, A. bedai Vanzolini 1991c, A. borelli Peracca, 1897, A. cuiabana Strüssman and Carvalho, 2001, A. frontalis Vanzolini 1991b, A. hastata Vanzolini 1991a, A. occidentalis Cope, 1875, A. plumbea Gray, 1872, A. polygrammica Werner, 1901, A. steindachneri Strauch, 1881, and A. townsendi Stejneger, 1912. Amphisbaena sanctaeritae differs from all 11 species by having 10 dorsal segments at a midbody annulus (≥ 12 in the other species). The number of ventral segments at a midbody annulus (14) further distinguishes it from A. bedai (16–18), A. borelli (16–20), A. hastata (16), A. occidentalis (24–28), A. plumbea (20–30), A. polygrammica (26), and A. townsendi (24–28). It also differs from A. arenaria, A. bedai, A. borelli, A. cuiabana, A. frontalis, and A. steindachneri by having a row of post-malar scales. Finally, A. sanctaeritae further differs from A. arenaria, A. bedai, and A. borelli by having precloacal pores in a continuous series (vs. with a median hiatus), from A. borelli and A. cuiabana by lacking a dorsal sulcus, and from A. borelli, A. cuiabana, and A. steindachneri by lacking a vertical keel at  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  tip (Costa et al. 2019).<br>

Amphisbaena silvestrii	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Diagnosis: A form of Amphisbaena with the postrostral head shields paired, the midventral segments of each annulus broadened to twice their length and with a single pair of round precloacal pores. Specimens have 179 to 181  <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : red;">body annuli</span> | 20 to 21  <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : red;">caudal annuli</span> | an autotomy constriction at the 4th and 6th postcloacal annulus| 10 to 12 dorsal and 10 to 12  <span style="color: red;">ventral segments</span>  to a midbody annulus| and  <span style="color: green;">4</span>  <span style="color: red;">precloacal segments</span>  Most of each animal is colored a  <span style="color: green;">dark brown</span>  set off by a  <span style="color: green;">lighter</span>  <span style="color: red;">edge</span>  around each segment, the width of the  <span style="color: red;">edge</span>  becoming greater ventrally. The  <span style="color: red;">intersegmental raphes</span>  are  <span style="color: green;">light</span>  The dark  <span style="color: red;">color</span>  drops out by segments along the  <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : red;">chin</span>  <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : red;">cloacal region</span>  and the anterior portion of the  <span style="color: red;">ventral surface</span> (Gans 1962).Notes on the type.-The specimen is well preserved with only slight fading of the  <span style="color: red;">color</span>  but appears to have been cut into two pieces prior to preservation. The jagged edges of the skin fit, suggesting that nothing was lost. The agreement with the original description confirms the status of the specimen (Gans 1962).Description: Meristic characters are summarized in Table 1. Figure 3 shows views of the head, Figure 5 of the cloaca and tail, and Figure 7 photographs of the  <span style="color: red;">color</span>  pattern. The preserved specimens are a dark chocolate brown with the segmental margins, <span style="color: red;">intersegmental raphes</span>  and anterior  <span style="color: red;">ventral segments</span>  completely  <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : green;"> <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : green;"> <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">bleached</span> </span> </span> </span>  The  <span style="color: red;">color</span>  is densest on the dorsal surfaces of the head and tail. The dorsal region is  <span style="color: green;">darker</span>  than the ventral because of the narrower  <span style="color: green;">light</span>  margins. The  <span style="color: red;">rostral tip</span>  the  <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : red;">chin</span>  region, and the anterior quarter of the  <span style="color: red;">ventral surface</span>  are  <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : green;"> <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : green;"> <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">bleached</span> </span> </span> </span>  In the type the dark  <span style="color: red;">color</span>  also encroaches onto the  <span style="color: red;">ventral surface</span>  thereafter, while the Xingi6 specimen shows a more gradual invasion with occasional  <span style="color: green;">light</span>  colored segments or groups of segments along the midline. The  <span style="color: red;">xingu specimen</span>  also has a  <span style="color: green;">light</span>  area around and including the cloaca. The  <span style="color: red;">head scalation</span>  is characterized by  <span style="color: green;">lack of major fusions</span>  The first two  <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : red;">body annuli</span>  correspond to  <span style="color: green;">two dorsal half-annuli</span>  The segments of the first are commonly referred to as temporal and postocular and abut middorsally on the frontals. The  <span style="color: red;">second body annulus</span>  <span style="color: green;">culminates dorsally</span>  in the pair of enlarged parietals. The  <span style="color: red;">third annulus</span>  <span style="color: green;">ascends in a plane normal to the long axis</span>  and is only differentiated by a wider than normal pair of middorsal segments. The  <span style="color: red;">xingu specimen</span>  shows the temporal and postlabial fused to the corresponding segments of the  <span style="color: red;">second body annulus</span>  which is distinct both dorsally and ventrally to this point. The next three annuli are slightly narrowed, more so in the Cuiaba, than in the Xingui specimen. The  <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : red;">chin</span>  is characterized by a small symphysial, very large second infralabials, large malars, two rows of postgenials, and no postmalars. The fourth, fifth, and sixth  <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : red;">body annuli</span>  are slightly narrowed, more so in the Cuiaba than in the Xingi specimens. The  <span style=" <span style="color: red;">color</span> : red;">body annuli</span>  are characterized by a complete lack of asymmetries so that the numbers of dorsal and ventral half-annuli are identical. The lateral sulci are clearly marked from four lengths behind the head to the cloaca. The dorsal and ventral sulci are indicated only by aligned raphes, with the ventral sulcus a common site of folding. The cloaca is preceded by four large segments. The tail is elongate, cylindrical, and terminally rounded. The autotomy constriction is expressed by a narrowed annulus of reduced diameter, posterior to which autotomy takes place. The middorsal segments are slightly longer than wide, those along the midventral line two to three times as wide as long, with considerable change from front to rear (Gans 1962).<br>

Amphisbaena slateri	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Diagnosis: Among the Bolivian and Peruvian amphisbaenians (characters inside parenthesis) the round head distinguishes Amphisbaena slateri from A. kingii Bell, 1833, (keel-headed) and Leposternon microcephalum Wagler, 1824 (shovel-headed). The four precloacal pores distinguish it from A. silvestrii Boulenger, 1902 (two pores) and A. fuliginosa Linnaeus, 1758 (6–10 pores). The presence of 176–213 body annuli distinguishes A. slateri from A. borelli Peracca, 1897 (239–261), A. occidentalis Cope, 1876 (262–275), A. polygrammica Werner, 1900 (270), A. steindachneri Strauch, 1881 (255–266), and A. townsendi Stejneger, 1911 (261–279). By having 10–14 dorsal segments at midbody, A. slateri differs from A. alba (30–42), A. angustifrons Cope, 1861 (20–31), A. bolivica Mertens, 1929 (27–38), A. camura Cope, 1862 (28–42), A. cegei Montero, Sáfadez & Álvarez, 1997 (17–22), and A. vermicularis Wagler, 1824 (18–26). Amphisbaena slateri differs from A. heterozonata Burmeister, 1861 – sometimes considered a subspecies of A. darwinii Duméril & Bibron, 1839 (Montero 2016) – by the having 20–24 caudal annuli (vs. 13–18), enlarged parietals (vs. rarely enlarged), and a uniform body coloration (vs. dorsum brown, venter cream). Despite a small overlap in midbody dorsal/ventral segment counts between A. slateri (10–14/14–16) and A. heterozonata (14–24/15–28), specimens of the later most commonly have 16/18 segments. Finally, A. slateri differs from A. pericensis Noble, 1921 by lacking a compressed tail tip (vs. slightly laterally compressed), by having a postmental longer than the mental (vs. postmental faintly longer than mental) and having a uniform body coloration (vs. dorsum brown, venter cream). A summary of morphological characters useful to identify Peruvian and Bolivian amphisbaenids is present in Table 2.Expanding comparisons to all Neotropical amphisbaenians, we find an overlap of most morphological character states between A. slateri and A. albocingulata Boettger, 1885, A. darwinii Duméril & Bibron, 1839, A. hogei Vanzolini, 1950, A. manni Barbour, 1914, A. mensae Castro-Mello, 2000, A. munoai Klappenbach, 1960, A nigricauda Gans, 1966, A. prunicolor (Cope, 1885), A. schmidti Gans, 1964, and A. talisiae Vanzolini, 1995. The uniform  <span style="color: red;">color</span>  pattern of A. slateri distinguishes it from A. albocingulata, A. darwinii, A. hogei, A. mensae, A. munoai, A. nigricauda, A. schmidti, and A. talisiae (countershading pattern), and from A. prunicolor (venter with a checkerboard pattern). By presenting a modal number of 14 midbody ventral segments, Amphisbaena slateri differs from A. hogei, A. manni, A. munoai, A. nigricauda, A. prunicolor, and A. schmidti (16), A. albocingulata (18), and A. darwinii (20). While all known specimens of A. slateri have four precloacal pores, most specimens of A. manni have six pores – females of A. nigricauda and A. prunicolor lack pores, but this trait is unknown in A. slateri, since no specimen was sexed. Postmental is distinctly longer than wide in A. slateri, while it is almost long as wide in A. darwinii, A. mensae, A. munoai, A. nigricauda, A. prunicolor, and A. talisiae. Parietals are enlarged in A. slateri, but not in A. manni and are irregular in A. darwinii. Finally, while the tail tip is rounded in A. slateri, it is  <span style="color: green;">conical</span>  in A. manni and has a slight lateral constriction in A. darwinii, A. hogei, and A. nigricauda (from Costa et al. 2018).<br>

<i>dorsal segments: 12-13</i><br>
<br>
Amphisbaena vermicularis	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	DIAGNOSIS: A medium- to large-sized, elongate form of Amphisbaena having a fairly blunt snout| without fusion of head shields| with the prefrontals the largest segments by far| with minimal enlargement of parietals| with generally four supra- and three infralabials| and with a relatively long, cylindrical, bluntly terminating tail. The form has 211 to 254 body annuli| five to seven (generally six) caudal annuli up to the autotomy constriction (at which the tail is autotomized in 23.6 per cent of the specimens) | 23 to 30 caudal annuli from the cloaca to the tip of the tail, which may be slightly compressed in a very few specimens| 18 to 26 dorsal and 18 to 25 ventral segments to a mid-body annulus| and four round precloacal pores in all specimens. The tail is characteristically elongate and cylindrical| the species has only lateral sulci. The color of preserved specimens is a uniform brownish dorsally, becoming lighter ventrally. The coloration occasionally gives the impression of being denser along the anterior edge of each annulus, with the fading-out along the side occurring diagonally from posterior to anterior edge of an annulus. The dorsal surface of the tail and of the head are darker, but the intersegmental sutures are lightened, thereby giving the neck a characteristic reticulated pattern (Gans & Amdur 1966: 71).GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION: The available samples are insufficient for more than a preliminary estimation of trends. Adequate representation is most clearly available for some localities in the states Pernambuco, Bahia, Minas Gerais, and Goias, though even these states hardly show a complete sampling. The records for Para come from enough sources to suggest that A. vermicularis occurs in that state, though the specimens may not actually stem from the (rain forest?) sites from which they are recorded. The Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro records are probably spurious, but there is no reason to doubt the Bolivian one, so that the species may well extend close to the foothills of the Andes. Unfortunately there is a large, but disappointing (since probably composite) series labeled with such central Brazilian place names as Borba. Cuyaba. and Rio Branco. These Menna Museum specimens stem from the Xatterer collection, known to have become confused (Gans, 1955), and internal evidence suggests that this is indeed the case. The general pattern of geographical variation is highly complex, and shows only a few sharp boundaries and almost no concordance. While there are several instances of marked local differences for individual characters, as yet there is no reason for recognizing subspecies within this assemblage. Publication of the available data may permit future workers to test and refine the roughly sketched pattern.(1) Number of body annuli. Figure 2A presents a summary of the variation of number of body annuli. The highest values are found in the northeast where A. vermicularis overlaps A. pretrei (Gans, 1965) which also has high values. Somewhat lower values are found in Goiás and possibly in a narrow corridor extending into Bolivia. The two latter groupings are separated by an area of very low counts in inland Bahia. Equivalent low counts are found in southern Minas Gerais (Lagoa Santa), while southern Bahia, northern Minas Gerais specimens, as well as those from the northernmost parts of the species range, have intermediate values. (2) Number of caudal annuli. Figure 2 B presents a summary of the variation of this character. Again there is a tendency for high values in the northeast and in a belt inland to Bolivia. Yet the borders of the region are shifted significantly from those for high numbers of body annuli. There is no significant difference between the counts of the southern and the northern populations. The high values in the zone of sympatry with A. pretrei are of interest as these increase the difference between the two forms. (3) Number of segments to a mid-body annulus. This character shows great intraspecimen and intrasample variation, which masks any geographic variation. The reality of the trends in the present material will have to be checked on the basis of larger series. (4) Body size. Amphisbaena vermicularis is a much smaller species than A. pretrei. Histograms for several geographically defined populations (fig. 3) do not furnish grounds for assuming differences between them. The northern samples are obviously too small to permit comment. (5) Relative tail length. The tail of A. vermicularis is relatively longer than that of A. pretrei or A. leucocephala. Tendency to intermediacy occurs in specimens of A. vermicularis from outside of the region of sympatry. Specimens from Bahia and Minas Gerais have the longest, and those from Cara to Sergipe and Goiás to Bolivia relatively the shortest tails, though there is extensive scatter and broad overlap between samples (fig. 3). It is interesting to note that the sample from Bom Jesus de Lapa differs from the rest of the Bahia sample by having a significantly shorter tail, as do some of the Vienna Museum specimens from "Mato Grosso." These samples show no other correlated differences. (6) Color pattern. A number of specimens from localities in Pará, Goiás, Minas Gerais, and Bolivia show an accentuation of the pigment along the anterior edge of each segment (cf. fig. 6). Only in Santa Isabel is this pattern found in all specimens of a sample| its frequency is low in other cases. Such accentuation (as opposed to an evenly distributed dorsal pigmentation) is always restricted to the anterior segmental edge, rather than covering half the segment as in A. mertensi Strauch (Gans, manuscript). (7) Head segmentation. The parietals are generally small segments but slightly larger than the oculars, though they very occasionally exceed the frontals in size. Considerable variation exists within the species, indeed between the left and right sides of some specimens (fig. 5), but this does not seem geographically correlated or constant within single populations. The specimens with enlarged parietals are thus scattered over the entire range. Furthermore, the enlargement is extensive relative only to the condition found in most specimens of A. vermicularis| it almost never attains the proportions shown by specimens of A. mertensi. (8) Precloacal pores. All specimens except three out of a series of seven from Cana Brava, Goiás have four precloacal pores. The latter series has four specimens with four, two with five, and one with six pores.

In general there are in the former fewer and relatively larger scales, but their relationships and mechanical functions are clearly the same. Rostral supported behind by the prefrontals which are very large, occupying most of the side of the  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  in contact on the midline, not fused in the specimens seen. Frontais small but distinct, oblong, placed between the prefrontals and a subsequent row of scales, made of four median squarish elements in contact with the frontais, and, laterally, of a series of elongate vertical scales, behind the ocular and the labials, variously divided, continuing ventrally into the row of post-genials. This row of scales, which I call the  <span style="color: red;">post-frontal annulus</span>  <span style="color: green;">separated from the next one by a deep sulcus, lined with wrinkled skin</span> ( not proper granules), ending a little below the levei of the angle of the mouth. <span style="color: red;">ocular scale</span>  <span style="color: green;">very small, sub-triangular, fitting between the prefrontal, the second supralabial and the  <span style="color: red;">post-frontal annulus</span> </span>  Eye inapparent. The only other scale on the face is the nasal, which deeply indents the rostral, rests on the first supralabial and narrowly meets the second one. Nostril pierced well in front. Supralabials two, the second by far the largest. Symphysial somewhat irregular, with small anvil-shaped processes. Postsymphysial elongate, pentagonal, also somewhat irregular, narrowly meeting the first infralabial in front. Geniais, mediai and lateral, rather regular. One single post-genial row, merging into the  <span style="color: red;">post-frontal annulus</span>  Dorsal segments squarish, ventral ones a little wider. Longitudinal sutures approximately but not precisely aligned. <span style="color: red;">lateral sulci</span>  normal for amphisbaenids, shallow, consisiting of a succession of X-shaped wrinkles, beginning at the levei of  <span style="color: red;">body</span>  annulus 70 extending to the last  <span style="color: red;">body</span>  annulus. Ventral sulcus simply a sharp angle along the line ofmedian segment sutures. The dorsal sulcus may appear only as a short sequence of misaligned irregular segments, or this area may be raised (probably by muscular contraction) in a sort of low crest, some 10 annuli long. The large button on the tip of the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  is not segmented. Preanal flap formed by 10 segments, the central pair largest. Post-anal rim formed by  <span style="color: green;">15-17</span>  segments, squarish on the middle, becoming wrinkled on the sides (Vanzolini 1999).<br>

(Vanzolini 1999)DESCRIPTION: Rostral very large, arcuate, with prominent cutting edge, reaching dorsally the levei of the eye, its hind margin roughly parallel to the edge, variously but never much indented. Supporting the rostral from behind two arches of scales. The anterior one abuts in front and below against the upper half of the nasal. It is constituted by up to 3 elements, that may be ali fused in a single prefrontal. The uppermost scales touch or closely miss each other on the midline| they may be fused there. The second arch supporting the rostral begins behind in a large polygonal, salient scale, that may be called a frontal, in front of which there are usually two polygonal scales, in the position of pre-and supra-oculars. These scales may be occasionally fused or split. Ocular irregularly polygonal| the eye appears as a diffuse spot. Nasals narrow and elongate| nostril pierced near the front edge. Three large supralabials, the first the longest, the second the highest. The first labial is more or less coterminous with the nasal| the second supports the preocular| the ocular rests on the angle between the second and the third supralabials. Behind the latter a row of scales, not showing on the top differentiated parietals or occipitals, but including a large polygonal scale in the position of a postocular| under this a vertical row of three segments, continuing behind the third labial as a body annulus. Symphysial anvil-shaped, squarish. Post-symphysial pentagonal, often irregular. Three infralabials, the second the largest. Genial region extremely variable. On one extreme a regular pattem of normally shaped mediai and lateral geniais, followed by a row of 8 post-genials| fusions and splittings are frequent, however. Lateral body sulci consisting, as usual in amphisbaenids, of a succession of X-shaped wrinkles, beginning between the 15th and 30th  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  and extending to the last body annulus. A  <span style="color: red;">dorsal sulcus</span>  is not  <span style="color: green;">apparent</span>  in about one fifth of the specimens examined. When present it consists of irregularities on the edges of the median segments| in fact, it is never a proper sulcus. The  <span style="color: red;">ventral sulcus</span>  absent in one half of the specimens, is, when present, similar to the dorsal one. The conditions of the two sulci are not statistically associated. <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  <span style="color: green;">214-244</span>  with many irregularities, especially incomplete annuli and spiral confluences. <span style="color: red;">dorsal segments</span>  <span style="color: green;">12-19</span>  longerthan wide. <span style="color: red;">ventral segments</span>  <span style="color: green;">14-22</span>  squarish. <span style="color: red;">preanal pores</span>  usually 4, widely variable in expression, from very slight impressions to definite  <span style="color: green;">rounded</span>  pigmented orifices. In one specimen, and in cases in the literature, no pores could be discerned. The anal flap is composed of 6 scales in palisade. The posterior rim of the anus has 10-12 scales, larger on the middle. <span style="color: red;">tail cylindrical</span>  to the autotomy levei (in ali specimens examined the seventh annulus) which is irregular in extent and outline. Distally the tail is moderately but distinctly  <span style="color: red;">clavate</span> | the tip is round, smooth or segmented. There are mentions in the literature of the presence of white spots on the snout and tail. I saw none. All my specimens were gray, somewhat darker on the dorsum, as if countershaded (Vanzolini 1999).<br>

A single precloacal pore or pore scar lies lateral to each end of the precloacal row, and the tail is short and equipped with a very narrow autotomy site after which it bulges. The dorsal surface bears faintly knobbed segments. There are 182 to 192 body annuli| 13 to 14 caudal annuli| and 16 to 20 dorsal and 18 to 20 ventral segments to a midbody  <span style="color: red;">annulus</span>  Dorsal and ventral sulci are absent, but the lateral sulci are very clearly marked.

Cynisca bifrontalis	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Original description: Boulenger 1906: 202DIAGNOSIS: Preocular supralabials, nasal, preocular, and prefrontal fused, with blind suture entering fused shield from the anterior tip of the rectangular ocular. Subrectangular frontal and larger parietal discrete with long medial contact on midline| occipitals tiny. First postocular supralabial contacts frontal. A single very large temporal lies dorsal to the first postsupralabial and is followed by two smaller ones dorsal to the second. Head bulbous. 2 supralabials and 2 infralabials. Mental wider than first infralabials| malars slightly enlarged, enclosing two rows of postgenials, 4 segments in the first row, 4 in the second. 240 body annuli (tail autotomized). Midbody segments, 8 dorsal, 8 ventral. Median ventral segments enlarged, paired. 10 (poorly expressed) precloacal pores (in female holotype). Autotomy site at the 11th caudal annulus. (Gans 1987: 32)Description (Pattern XIII): Meristic characters are summarized in table 1. Figures 16 and 7 show the views of the head, figure 13 the ventral surface of the cloacal region, figure 11 the segment proportions as well as the pattern at midbody, figure 14 lateral view of tail and caudal region| figure 6 gives the body proportions. This is a small, relatively slender species of Cynisca. The type is faded to a uniform pale brown. The anterior head shields show major fusions. The rostral is relatively small and not visible in dorsal view. It is followed posteriorly by enormous paired shields that cover the bulbously swollen snout and apparently include the regions occupied by the preocular supralabials, the nasals, the preoculars, and the prefrontals| the vertical posterior suture of these shields with the third supralabial (first postocular supralabial) bisects the position of the eye. There iS no supraocular. The rectangular ocular is diagonally placed near the upper two-thirds of the supralabial suture. A blind suture extends anteriorly into the compound shield from its anterior corner. The posterior corner gives rise to the medial suture of the second supralabial (or first postocular one) with the frontal. The shallowly convex anterior edge of the frontal is followed by a straight inward-angling suture with the supralabial, a short even more angling suture with the large temporal, and a transverse suture with the large hexagonal parietal. The posteriorly asymmetrical parietals are but slightly narrower, but much longer than the frontals. Laterally, each parietal is in contact with a hexagonal temporal and it in turn with the rectangular postsupralabial. The right side of the dorsal half-annulus of the second body annulus includes the tiny occipital (fused to the parietal on the left side), which is smaller and shorter than the gabled flanking shields, each of which inserts between a parietal and temporal. Consequently, the enlarged cephalic shields only include the dorsal segments of the first two body annuli. The snout is prognathous and the rostral is visible only in ventral view. The deep lower jaw is partially inserted into the bulbous snout which is almost twice as wide as high. In ventral view, the mental is slightly narrower than the enormous infralabials| however, the area of the latter is greater. The suture defining the posterior edges of the very large mental and the flanking first infralabials cross the chin at the level of the second infralabials| along the posteromedial portion of the infralabials this suture swings slightly antero-medially SO that the widened malars correspond to two rows of four postgenials, rather than single row. The second infralabials are small and their anterior suture extends anteriorly from the junction with the malars to the lip. Two wide segments, flanked by a narrower one on each side, occupy the first postmental row| the latter elements lie medial to the malars, but posterior to the first infralabials. The segments of the gular region (annuli one through four) are slightly reduced in size and the midventral segments of the next annulus show the widening of the medial segments. The type has 240 body annuli, from the first segments posterior to the angulus oris up to and including the pore-bearing precloacal row. There are no obvious fusions, except for a spiral displacement just anterior to the cloaca| the four anteriormost dorsal half-annuli are narrowed and deeply folded. At midbody an annulus contains eight squarish to longer than wide dorsal segments and eight ventral ones, the medial about 2½ times as wide as long. The cloacal region corresponds to three lateral annuli. The healed autotomized tail bears 11 caudal annuli before an oval end. There are eight precloacal pore scars lacking secretion cores, each inserted into the center of the posterior edge of one of the narrow median segments of the precloacal annulus. This set corresponds to the width of the enlarged pair of medial ventral segments. The rounded precloacal shield consists of two very wide median plus three left and two right narrower flanking segments, some of which extend laterally beyond the round portion. The narrow postcloacal edge is formed of 12 segments. The trunk is generally rounded| however, it becomes slightly wider than high just anterior to the cloacal region and the tail is flattened (which may be an artifact of preservation). The healed caudal tip forms a distinct horizontal oval in cross section. The lateral sulci start at the level of the 12th body annulus, are filled with small triangular segments, and at midbody are approximately one-third the width of a flanking segment. Anteriorly (for the first 70 or so annuli), the middorsal sulcus is indicated only by alignment of intersegmental sutures. At midbody, it is almost as wide as the lateral ones and continues as a depressed groove onto the base of the tail. There IS no ventral sulcus. (Gans 1987: 32)<br>

Autotomy site at the 6th and 8th caudal annulus.DESCRIPTION (Pattern X): Meristic characters are summarized in table 7. Figures 17 and 7 show the views of the head, figure 13 the ventral surface of the cloacal region, figure 11 the segment proportions as well as the pattern at midbody, figure 14 lateral view of tail and caudal region| figure 6 gives the body proportions. This is a small, relatively slender species of Cynisca. Preserved specimens are a uniform pale brown dorsally and are slightly lighter on the ventral surface. The pigment density increases posteriorly and is greatest on the first half of the tail. Here there is a tendency for faint concentration of pigment in the segmental centers. The dorsal surface of the head and first five to seven dorsal half-annuli lack pigmentation, as do the second infralabials, though the rest of the chin iS pigmented. The anterior head shields show major fusions. The  <span style="color: red;">rostral</span>  is relatively small and barely visible in dorsal view. It is followed posteriorly by enormous paired shields that cover the bulbously swollen snout and apparently include the regions occupied by the preocular supralabials, the nasals, the oculars, and the prefrontals| the vertical posterior suture of these shields either bisects or follows just anterior to the position of the  <span style="color: red;">eye</span>  A diagonally running blind suture extends into this compound shield from just above the level of the  <span style="color: red;">eye</span>  and passes ventrolateral. The position of the former ocular would correspond to the zone just ventral and posterior to this suture (a ventral suture remains azygously on CZL 1945.138). The second supralabial (or first postocular one) extends dorsally to the level where the blind suture terminates and is in broad horizontal contact with the parallel-sided widened anterior portion of the bottle-shaped frontal-parietal-occipital shield. (There is some question whether these compound. shields include fused occipitals as a few specimens show enlargement of the median segments of the first postcephalic annulus.) Immediately posterior to contact with the second supralabial, the fused median shields narrow sharply or gradually and extend to the first dorsal half-annulus. In some specimens (BM 1946.9.1.13) both the medial and lateral sutures of the median shields may be interrupted and irregular in the transition zone. An enormous temporal shield lies lateral to the frontal-parietal-occipital and between the medial portion of the second supralabial and the frst dorsal half-annulus (which corresponds to the third ventral one). The temporal abuts ventrally onto the rectangular postsupralabial (or onto one or two squarish postsupralabials), though the several sutures tend to be shallowly inscribed and may be missing. The fused head shields occupy the place of the dorsal half of the first two body annuli. The snout is prognathous and the  <span style="color: red;">rostral</span>  IS obvious in ventral, but not in dorsal view. The lower jaw is not particularly deeply inserted into the bulbous snout, which is almost twice as wide as high. In ventral view, the  <span style="color: red;">mental</span>  is larger than the infralabials| however, the area of the latter is greater. The suture defining the posterior edges of the very large  <span style="color: red;">mental</span>  and the flanking first infralabials crosses the chin at the anterior level of the second infralabials| this suture often swings slightly anteromedially, and the enlarged malars generally correspond to two rows of postgenials, rather than a single one. The second infralabials are small| their anterior suture extends anteriorly from the malar junction to the lip. Only the medial pair of the two segments occupying the postmalar position is regularly larger than the segments of posterior body annuli. One wide or two narrow median segments lie back of the center of the  <span style="color: red;">mental</span> | they form the center of the first of two rows generally containing four postgenials each. The segments of the gular region are slightly reduced in size and the midventral segments of the seventh annulus show the first indication of fusion of the medial segments. There are 244-265 body annuli, from the first segments posterior to the angulus oris up to and including the pore-bearing precloacal row. The dorsal portions of the seven to eight discrete dorsal half-annuli are narrowed and deeply folded. At midbody an annulus contains 12 to 14 (generally 14) squarish to longer than wide dorsal segments and seven to nine ventral ones (generally seven or nine), the unpaired medial ones more than four times as wide as long. The cloacal region corresponds to two to four lateral annuli. The tail bears 20 to 25 caudal annuli before an oval end, which is generally twice or more as long as the last annulus and bears faintly indented sutures only near its anterior edge. An autotomy site is marked at the sixth through eighth postcloacal annulus. It iS always well defined, being slightly narrowed and more intensely pigmented than other caudals. Ten of 32 specimens had broken tails. In some specimens, the first caudal annulus bears an azygous midventral segment| all other segments are paired. There are six variably produced precloacal pores, each inserted into the middle of the posterior edge of one of the six (five in ZMU 31184) narrow median segments of the precloacal annulus. This set corresponds to the width of the fused, azygous ventral segments and is flanked on each side by a larger segment that reaches laterally to the edge of the crescentic precloacal shield. The shield consists of two very wide median plus a pair of narrower and triangular flanking segments. The narrow postcloacal edge is formed of eight to ten segments. The trunk is generally slightly wider than high| however, it becomes rounded and slightly higher than wide just posterior to the cloacal region. The caudal tip forms a distinct vertical oval in cross section. The lateral sulci start at the level of the tenth body annulus, are filled with small triangular segments, and at midbody are approximately as wide as half of one of the flanking segments. Anteriorly (for the first 70 or so annuli), the middorsal sulcus is indicated only by alignment of intersegmental sutures. At midbody, it is almost as wide as the lateral ones and it continues as a depressed groove onto the base of the tail. There iS no ventral sulcus. (Gans 1987: 35)<br>

This is a  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">small</span> </span>  relatively slender species of Cynisca. Preserved specimens are a uniform brown dorsally, but are slightly lighter on the ventral surface. The pigment density increases posteriorly and is greatest on the first half of the tail. There is some tendency to a checkerboard dropout of pigment on the anterior ventral surface and near the cloacal region. In many specimens the ventral pigmentation becomes patchy on the individual segments. The chin and anterior ventral region are pale. The anterior  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  shields show major fusions. The  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">small</span> </span>  rostral is visible as a triangle in dorsal view. It is followed posteriorly by enormous paired shields that cover the bulbously swollen  <span style="color: red;">snout</span>  and apparently include the regions occupied by the preocular  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span>  the nasal, the preocular, and the prefrontal| the vertical posterior suture of these shields lies just anterior to the position of the eye so that the second supralabial (rather than the anterior compound shield) may include the ocular. The  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">large</span> </span>  second supralabial (or first postocular one) extends dorsally to narrow contact with the lateral edges of the  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">small</span> </span>  triangular frontal. The very  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">large</span> </span>  parietals include much of the area occupied in some other species by the postoculars and the temporals and broadly contact the  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">large</span> </span>  first  <span style="color: red;">postsupralabial</span>  which extends posteriorly dorsal to the second  <span style="color: red;">postsupralabial</span>  and is much higher than it is long at the postlabial edge. A pair of  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">small</span> </span>  triangular occipitals lies medial to the posterior portion of the parietals. The posterior tip of the parietals may keep them from contacting the very  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">small</span> </span>  temporals (which lie dorsal to the third  <span style="color: red;">postsupralabial</span> ). The second (and third) postsupralabials are  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">small</span> </span>  and irregular, as are the shields dorsal to them up to the midline. Most of these and the nuchal intercalated dorsal half-annulus cover the posterior portion of the  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  along the deep nuchal constriction and face posteriorly, indicating that only the anteriorly and dorsally directed shields are enlarged. The dorsal portions of the first three annuli are involved in cephalic coverage. The  <span style="color: red;">snout</span>  is prognathous and the rostral is far more obvious in ventral than in dorsal view. The lower jaw is not particularly deeply inserted into the  <span style="color: green;">bulbous</span>  <span style="color: red;">snout</span>  which is almost twice as wide as high. In ventral view, the mental is narrower than the  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span> | however, the area of the latter is greater. The anterior suture of the second infralabial extends anteriorly at an angle from the junction with the malars to the lip. The suture defining the posterior edges of the very  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">large</span> </span>  mental and the flanking first  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span>  swings anteromedially so that the enlarged squarish malars generally lie lateral to the posterior portion of the first and all of the second postgenial rows. The lateral postgenials of the first row on each side lie posterior to the first  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span>  and flank a single enlarged medial postgenial shield (specimen CG 3579 has four subequal first postgenials)| there are four smaller postgenials in the second row. The postmalars are slightly enlarged. The segments of the gular region are slightly reduced in size and the midventral segments of the seventh annulus show the first indication of fusion of the medial segments. An intercalated dorsal half-annulus lies near the eighth body annulus. There are 228 to 235  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  from the first segments posterior to the angulus oris up to and including the pore-bearing precloacal row. The dorsal portions of the seventh to eighth discrete dorsal half-annuli are narrowed and deeply folded. At midbody an annulus contains 12 1-1½ times as long as wide dorsal segments and 10 ventral ones, the medial ones about 2½ times as wide as long. The cloacal region corresponds to three to four  <span style="color: red;">lateral annuli</span>  The tail bears 21 to 22  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  before an oval end, which is generally twice or more as long as the last annulus and bears faintly indented sutures only near its anterior edge. An  <span style="color: red;">autotomy site</span>  is marked at the seventh to eighth postcloacal annulus. It is always well defined and slightly narrowed and more intensely pigmented than the  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  Two of six specimens have a broken tail. There are either ten or no variably produced  <span style="color: red;">precloacal pores</span>  each inserted into the middle of the posterior edge of one of the nine to ten narrow median segments of the precloacal annulus (some females show faint pore scars here). This set corresponds to the width of the enlarged midventral segments and precedes the edge of the crescentic precloacal shield. The shield consists of two very wide median plus two pairs of narrower and triangular flanking segments. The narrow postcloacal edge is formed of eight to ten segments. The trunk is generally slightly wider than high| however, it becomes rounded and slightly higher than wide just posterior to the cloacal region. The tail is of smaller diameter than the trunk. The caudal tip forms a distinct vertical oval in cross section. The lateral sulci start at the level of the 20th body annulus, are filled with  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">small</span> </span>  triangular segments, and at midbody are approximately as wide as half of one of the flanking segments. Anteriorly (for the first 40 or so annuli), the middorsal sulcus is indicated only by alignment of intersegmental sutures. At midbody, it is almost as wide as the lateral ones and it continues as a depressed groove onto the base of the tail. The ventral sulcus is only indicated by alignment of sutures.

Cynisca haugi	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Differentiation between C. haughi and C. bifrontalis is relatively minor (Gans 1987). It involves the lack of a discreet ocular in C. haughi (present in C. bifrontalis), and a caudal  <span style="color: red;">autotomy site</span>  at the level of the 7th caudal annulus (at the 11th in C. bifrontalis). Cynisca haughi may also have higher  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  counts ( <span style="color: green;">251</span>  in the holotype), although more material is required for confirmation. The holotype of C. bifrontalis has 240  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  whilst in the Toucan-Rabi series they range from only 229 to 231.DIAGNOSIS: <span style="color: red;">preocular supralabials</span>  <span style="color: red;">nasal</span>  <span style="color: red;">prefrontal</span>  preocular, and ocular fused, with blind suture entering  <span style="color: red;">fused shield</span>  from above the level of the eye. <span style="color: red;">large frontal</span>  and  <span style="color: red;">parietal</span>  discrete| occipital (?) tiny, smaller than flanking segments of second body annulus.

This is a small, relatively slender species of Cynisca. The type is faded to a uniform pale brown. The anterior head shields show major fusions. The rostral is relatively small, but visible in dorsal view. It is followed posteriorly by enormous paired shields that cover the bulbously swollen snout and apparently include the regions occupied by the  <span style="color: red;">preocular supralabials</span>  the  <span style="color: red;">nasal</span>  the preocular, and the  <span style="color: red;">prefrontal</span> | the vertical posterior suture of these shields with the second supralabial (first  <span style="color: red;">postocular supralabial</span> ) bisects the position of the eye. There is neither a discrete ocular nor a supraocular. A blind suture extends anteriorly into the compound shield just above the level at which the second supralabial is in broad horizontal contact with the parallel-sided frontal. (The entire anterior region is quite worn| however, application of a surface stain suggests that there may once have been a discrete squarish ocular with the blind suture being its dorsal margin.) The  <span style="color: red;">parietal</span>  IS also squarish, but slightly narrower than the frontal. Laterally, it is in contact with a parallelogramic  <span style="color: red;">temporal</span>  and it in turn with the squarish postsupralabial. The dorsal half-annulus of the second body annulus includes the widened and tiny occipitals (?), which are smaller than the flanking segments. Consequently, the enlarged cephalic shields only include the  <span style="color: red;">dorsal segments</span>  of the first (and part of the second) body annulus. The snout is prognathous and the rostral is far more obvious in ventral than in dorsal view. The lower jaw is inserted into the bulbous snout, which is almost twice as wide as high. In ventral view, the  <span style="color: red;">mental</span>  is narrower than the enormous infralabials| the area of the latter IS greater and the anterior edges between them are obscured. The suture defining the posterior edges of the very large  <span style="color: red;">mental</span>  and the flanking first infralabials crosses the chin at the level of the second infralabials| medially, this suture swings slightly anteriorly and then reverses. The enlarged  <span style="color: red;">malars</span>  correspond to two rows of postgenials, rather than a single one. The second infralabials are small and their anterior suture passes anteriorly from the junction with the  <span style="color: red;">malars</span>  to the lip. Two wide segments, flanked by a narrower one on each side, occupy the first postmental row| the latter elements lie posterior to the first infralabials. The second  <span style="color: red;">postgenial</span>  row contains five segments (four squarish and one asymmetrically positioned and triangular). The segments of the  <span style="color: red;">gular region</span>  are slightly reduced in size and the  <span style="color: red;">midventral segments</span>  of the seventh annulus show the first indication of enlargement of the medial segments. The type has  <span style="color: green;">251</span>  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  from the first segments posterior to the angulus oris up to and including the pore-bearing precloacal row. The dorsal portions of the first ten discrete dorsal half-annuli are irregular, involving fusions, and some are narrowed and deeply folded. At midbody, an annulus contains eight squarish to longer than wide  <span style="color: red;">dorsal segments</span>  and eight ventral ones, the medial about twice or slightly more as wide as long. The cloacal region corresponds to four lateral annuli. The  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  bears  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">27</span> </span>  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  before an oval end, which is generally twice or more as long as the last annulus and bears faintly indented sutures only near its anterior edge. An  <span style="color: red;">autotomy site</span>  is very faintly marked at the seventh (not the ninth, as indicated by Dunger, 1968) postcloacal annulus. The  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  of the holotype is intact. The first caudal annulus bears an azygous midventral segment| all other segments are paired. There are no precloacal pores, but eight (or ten) narrow median segments of the precloacal annulus lie in the position of pore-bearing segments. This set corresponds to the width of the enlarged pair of medial ventral segments. The rounded  <span style="color: red;">precloacal shield</span>  consists of two very wide median plus several narrower flanking segments some of which extend laterally beyond the round portion. The narrow  <span style="color: red;">postcloacal edge</span>  is formed of ten segments. The  <span style="color: red;">trunk</span>  is generally slightly wider than high| however, it becomes rounded and slightly higher than wide just posterior to the cloacal region. (The specimen is very desiccated and these are estimates.) The  <span style="color: red;">caudal tip</span>  forms a  <span style="color: green;">distinct vertical oval</span>  in cross section. The  <span style="color: red;">lateral sulci</span>  start at the level of the tenth body annulus, are  <span style="color: green;">filled with small triangular segments</span>  and at midbody are approximately as wide as half of one of the flanking segments. Anteriorly (for the first 100 or so annuli), the middorsal sulcus is indicated only by alignment of intersegmental sutures. At midbody, it is almost as wide as the lateral ones and it continues as a depressed groove onto the base of the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  There is no ventral sulcus.

Cynisca kigomensis	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Diagnosis: A medium-sized member of the genus Cynisca showing major fusion of the  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  shields, namely fusion of the 1st and 2nd supralabials with the nasal,prefrontal, frontal, and preocular shields. A pair of separate ocular shields, each in contact posteriorly with the upper half of the anterior margin of the posterior (3rd) supralabial and the outer half of the anterior margin of the postfrontal. A pair of postfrontals and a pair of large parietals| a small pair of interparietals of irregular shape and unequal size. Fusion of the 1st and 2nd supralabials| a posterior (3rd) larqe supralabial. Fusion of the 1st and 2nd  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span> | a small posterior (3rd) infralabial. <span style="color: red;">mental</span>  fused to the postmental| the postgenials in two rows,an anterior and a posterior each containing 4 segments. Postgenials flanked by enlarged malar shields. <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  258| lateral annuli 4| <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  <span style="color: green;">20-21</span>  with an autotomy constriction after the 7th. 8 precloacal pores in the male, none in the female| 6-8 precloacal segments and 8 postcloacal segments surround the cloacal slit. Segments in a midbody annulus 26-28, 14 dorsal and 12-14 ventral (from Dunger 1968).DIAGNOSIS: Preocular supralabials, nasal. prefrontal, and preocular fused. No blind suture enters fused shield. Frontal, large parietal, and small triangular occipital discrete. First postocular supralabial in point or narrow contact with the rounded lateral tip of the frontal. Discrete squarish diagonal ocular in anterior corner between these two shields. Parietal includes temporal region, dorsal to the postocular supralabial, the first and the second postsupralabial and two segments of the second body annulus. <span style="color: red;">snout</span>  <span style="color: green;">bulbous</span>  but  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  not very pointed. 2 supralabials and 2  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span>  <span style="color: red;">mental</span>  shorter than first  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span>  narrower in ventral view. Malars enlarged, enclosing posterior half of first and all of second postgenial row of four segments each. <span style="color: green;">256-258</span>  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span> | 20  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  <span style="color: red;">midbody segments</span>  <span style="color: green;">13-14 dorsal, 12-14 ventral</span>  Median ventral segments enlarged, paired. 8 or 0 precloacal pores. Autotomy site at the 7th to 8th caudal annulus. (Gans 1987: 41)DESCRIPTION (Pattern XIV): Meristic characters are summarized in table 2. Figures 20 and 8 show views of the  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  figure 13 the ventral surface of the cloacal region, figure 11 the segment proportions as well as the pattern at midbody, figure 14 lateral view of tail and caudal region| 6 figure 6 gives the body proportions. This is a medium-size species of Cynisca. Preserved specimens are a uniform  <span style="color: green;">pale brown</span>  dorsally, but are  <span style="color: green;">slightly lighter</span>  on the ventral surface. The  <span style="color: red;">pigment density</span>  <span style="color: green;">increases posteriorly</span>  and is greatest iS on the first half of the tail. Pigment also drops out in an irregular checkerboard pattern ventrally| also the cloacal region is unpigmented. The  <span style="color: red;">snout</span>  seems to lack pigmentation. The anterior  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  shields show major fusions. The small rostral is barely visible as a triangle in dorsal view. It is followed posteriorly by enormous paired shields that cover the bulbously swollen  <span style="color: red;">snout</span>  and apparently include the regions occupied by the preocular supralabials, nasals, preoculars, and prefrontals: the vertical posterior suture of these shields bisects the position of the eye. The small, squarish, diagonally placed ocular inserts into this compound shield anterior to the short contact zone between the postocular supralabial and the frontal. The large second supralabial (or first postocular one) extends dorsally to point contact with the rounded lateral tips of the triangular frontal (which is azygously irregular in AMNH 102425). The very large parietal includes much of the area otherwise occupied by the postocular and the temporals and broadly contacts the large first postsupralabial, which extends posteriorly dorsal to the second body annulus and is much higher than its length along the postlabial edge. A small triangular occipital (azygously irregular in AMNH 102425) lies medial to the posterior portion of the parietal. The second and third postsupralabials are small and irregular, as are the segments dorsal to them up to the midline. Most of these cover the posterior portion of the  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  and face posteriorly, indicating that only the anteriorly and dorsally directed shields are enlarged. A crescentic intercalated nuchal half-annulus follows. Whereas only one or two  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  are clearly incorporated in the enlarged  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  shields, the dorsal portions of the first three annuli are involved in cephalic coverage. The  <span style="color: red;">snout</span>  is  <span style="color: green;">prognathous</span>  and the rostral iS far more obvious in ventral than in dorsal view. The  <span style="color: red;">lower jaw</span>  is  <span style="color: green;">not particularly deeply inserted</span>  into the  <span style="color: green;">bulbous</span>  <span style="color: red;">snout</span>  which iS almost twice as wide as high. In ventral view, the  <span style="color: red;">mental</span>  is narrower than the  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span>  but the area of the latter is greater. The anterior suture of the second infralabial extends at an angle from the junction with the malars to the lip. The suture defining the posterior edges of the very large  <span style="color: red;">mental</span>  and the flanking first  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span>  first swings anteromedially and then slightly posteriorly toward the midline| thus, the enlarged pentagonal malars generally lie lateral to the posterior portion of the first and all of the second row of small paired postgenials of four segments each. The lateral postgenials on each side lie posterior to the  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span>  and to the posterior portion of the first row of postgenial segments. The  <span style="color: red;">postmalars</span>  are  <span style="color: green;">slightly enlarged</span>  The segments of the  <span style="color: red;">gular region</span>  are  <span style="color: green;">slightly reduced in size</span>  and the  <span style="color: red;">midventral segments</span>  of the seventh annulus show the  <span style="color: green;">first indication of fusion</span>  of the medial segments. An intercalated dorsal half-annulus lies near the ninth body annulus. There are 256 to 258  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  from the first segments posterior to the angulus oris up to and including the pore-bearing precloacal row. The dorsal portions of the seventh to eighth discrete dorsal half-annuli are narrowed and deeply folded. At midbody an annulus contains 13 to 14 (generally 14) 1½ to 2 times as long as wide dorsal segments and 12 or 14 ventral ones, the medial ones about 2½ times as wide as long. The cloacal region corresponds to three to four lateral annuli. The tail bears 20  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  before an oval end, which is generally twice or more as long as the last annulus and bears faintly indented sutures only near its anterior edge. An autotomy site is marked at the seventh to eighth postcloacal annulus. It is always well defined, both tail and autotomy annulus being slightly narrowed and more intensely pigmented. One of two specimens had a broken tail. There are eight or no variably produced precloacal pores, each inserted into the middle of the posterior edge of one of the seven to eight narrow median segments of the precloacal annulus. This set corresponds to the width of the enlarged  <span style="color: red;">midventral segments</span>  and turns around the anterior edge of the crescentic precloacal shield. The shield consists of two very wide median segments, plus a pair of narrower and triangular flanking segments. The narrow postcloacal edge is formed of eight to ten segments. The trunk is generally slightly wider than high| however, it becomes rounded and slightly higher than wide just posterior to the cloacal region. The caudal tip forms a distinct vertical oval in cross section. The lateral sulci start at the level of the 20th body annulus, are filled with small triangular segments, and at midbody are approximately as wide as half of one of the flanking segments. Anteriorly (for the first 30 or so annuli), the middorsal sulcus is indicated only by alignment of intersegmental sutures| at midbody, it is almost as wide as the lateral ones and continues as a depressed groove onto the base of the tail. The ventral sulcus is only indicated by alignment of sutures. (Gans 1987: 41)<br>

Cynisca kraussi	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	DIAGNOSIS: Nasal, preocular, and prefrontal discrete. Ocular discrete (pentagonal, diagonally placed). A small, median azygous shield in 9 of the 39 specimens. Two preocular and one postocular supralabials. Frontals small, triangular. Occipital relatively large, clearly derived from second body annulus. Very large postocular supralabial in narrow contact with postocular (-parietal) that has broad contact with the midline, with the occipital, and with a very large first postsupralabial that appears to have fused with the  <span style="color: red;">temporal</span>  Second postsupralabial small, forming part of second body annulus (that more dorsally contributes the occipitals). Snout generally pointed, preocular region swollen. <span style="color: green;">3</span>  supralabials and 2 infralabials. Mental flanked by enormous first infralabials| its posterior tip separated into a postmental. One row of 2-4 small postgenials anterior to the enlarged malars and a second row of 4 to 7 between them. 208-226  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span> | 16-19  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  Most specimens have a hump in the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  leading to a spatulate depressed distal tip covered dorsally by a rosette of segments (and which is underlain by a faint terminal ossification). Midbody segments, 14-20 dorsal, 12-16 ventral. Median ventral segments enlarged, paired. 8 large round precloacal pores. Autotomy site at the 6th to 7th caudal annulus. (Gans 1987: 43) DESCRIPTION (Patterns I/I): The meristic characters are summarized in table 4. Figures 23 and 8 show the views of the  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  figure 13 the ventral surface of the cloacal region, figure 11 the segment proportions as well as the pattern at midbody, figure 14 lateral view of  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  and caudal region, figure 21 the checkerboard coloration of the ventral surface, figure 22 details of the caudal rosette| figure 6 gives the body proportions and 39 provides radiographs of the caudal region in two specimens. This is a very small, slender species of Cynisca. Preserved specimens are light brown dorsally and lighter on the ventral surface| the countershading proceeds just at the lateral sulci. However, both the dorsal and the ventral surfaces are pigmented| this pigmentation fades ventrally. Darker specimens show an erratic, light checkerboard arrangement of pigmented segments on the ventral surface (fig. 21)| this IS not apparent in lighter specimens. The intersegmental sutures of the dorsal surface are faintly lightened. The dorsal pigmentation may be mottled. The dorsal surfaces of the top of the  <span style="color: red;">head</span> (particularly the frontals) of the posterior quarter of the trunk and of the caudal region are somewhat darker than those of the anterior trunk. The pigmentation of the autotomy annulus does not differ dorsally, but is denser ventrally. The caudal rosette is colored a very dark leaden gray (rather than brown) and even the ventral portion of the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  is darkened. The autotomy annulus is darkened both dorsally and ventrally. The anterior  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  shields show no major fusions. The rostral is visible in dorsal view as a small triangle. Posteriorly, it is followed on each side by a large nasal that sends a short wing to meet the preocular. The first preocular supralabial is longer than the second. The preocular contacts both these supralabials, the ocular, the prefrontal, and the nasal. The preocular of CAS 127398 is fused to the prefrontal and ocular on the left side. The diagonally placed ocular is longer than wide| the large eye lies just ventral to its center, and there is no supraocular. The prefrontals appear roughly rectangular in dorsal view, cover much of the dorsal surface of the snout anterior to the level of the eyes, and may include between them a small (sometimes absent) quadratic azygous shield. The convex posterior edge of this shield interdigitates between the anterior edges of the relatively small frontal shields. The anterior frontal edge extends anteriorly to the lateral tips of the azygous shield| the edge then continues posterolaterally to reach point contact with the dorsal tip of the oculars, then gradually narrows toward the midline, which it reaches at a level anterior to the angulus oris. The parietals are in variable contact along the midline, the contact often being longer than either that of the frontal or the occipital. It occupies the area otherwise filled by the postocular and consequently has narrow contact with the third supralabial and wide contact with the enormous postsupralabial, which widens dorsally. The second body annulus swings slightly anteriorly in the  <span style="color: red;">temporal</span>  region and contains three small segments dorsal to the second postsupralabial| these are followed in turn by a large occipital flanking the midline. The latter is almost as large as the frontal| however, it seems as if the enlarged  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  shields only incorporate the dorsal segments of the first two  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  The middorsal segments of the third dorsal halfannulus may be enlarged. The nuchal region shows some irregularity. The third body annulus tends to be very narrow laterally just posterior to the postsupralabials and the fourth body annulus may be widened. There are no intercalated dorsal half-annuli. In general, the fused  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  shields occupy the place of the dorsal half of the first two  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  The snout is markedly prognathous and the rostral is clearly visible in ventral view. The large mental iS narrower posteriorly than anteriorly and is significantly shorter than the flanking enormous and considerably longer first infralabials. The anterior sutures of the small second infralabials extend at an angle from the malar junction to the lip. The anteriormost space between the first infralabials is occupied by a small postmental. The malars are enlarged. Anterior and medial to them lies a row of two to four postgenials, only the medial pair of which lies directly posterior to the postmental| a second row of five to seven postgenials follows between the malars. The ventral segments of the first five  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  are reduced in size. Some specimens show fusion or other irregularities in the region of the 10th to 12th ventral annuli before the fully widened midventral segments appear. There are 211 to 226  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  from the first segment posterior to the angulus oris up to and including the pore-bearing precloacal row. The dorsal portion of the second to sixth discrete half-annuli may be narrowed and folded. At midbody an annulus contains 14 to 20 twice as long as wide dorsal segments and 12 to 16 (generally 12 to 14) ventral ones| the medial segments are 1¼4 times as wide as long. The cloacal region corresponds to two to four lateral annuli. The  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  bears 16 to 20  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  the last  <span style="color: green;">3</span>  to 5 much narrower dorsally than ventrally, and the last one visible in ventral view showing an array of narrow elongated segments that completely occupies the caudal tip. The segments occupying the flattened dorsoposterior aspect of the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  are tightly joined so that the interannular sutures are no wider than the intersegmental ones. They form a series of concentric rings with the center filled with somewhat larger segments. In some specimens these segments are faintly produced into cones. However, in the largest specimens the caudal tip appears to be worn smooth. A narrowed and markedly pigmented autotomy site occurs on the sixth to seventh postcloacal position. (Eight of the 39 specimens show autotomy.) There are eight large round precloacal pores, each inserted into the center of the posterior edge of one of the eight segments of the precloacal annulus, those of the males bearing projecting cores. The pore-bearing row corresponds to the full width of the ventral region, as well as to that of the precloacal shield. The latter has a central posteriorly curved portion, that is covered by four parallel-sided segments, the median ones the largest, followed laterally by a gradually diminishing section of two segments. The postcloacal edge is formed of 10 to 12 segments. The snout is markedly pointed, more in dorsal than in lateral view. At the level of the nostrils it is half as wide as at the level of the postsupralabials. The snout is vertically swollen anterior to the level of the eyes. The  <span style="color: red;">temporal</span>  region is hardly wider than the trunk at the level of the third through eighth annuli. The trunk is rounded anteriorly and variably compressed dorsoventrally thereafter onto the base of the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  After the autotomy level it suddenly becomes higher than wide to form a dorsal hump, shortly posterior to which the spatulate distal section is compressed into a horizontal wedge. The lateral sulci start at the 20th to 50th body annulus, being indicated anteriorly only by alignment of sutures| at midbody an annulus is more than one-half the width of an adjacent segment and contains large triangular segments. The dorsal sulcus is marked from near the 70th annulus and is narrower than the lateral ones. It continues as a deep groove onto the base of the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  though the intercalated segments drop out at the level of the cloaca. The ventral sulcus is indicated only by an alignment of sutures. (Gans 1987: 43)<br>

Figures 24 and 8 show views of the head, figure 13 the ventral surface of the cloacal region, figure 11 the segment proportions as well as the pattern at midbody, figure  <span style="color: green;">14</span>  lateral view of  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  and caudal region| figure 6 gives the body proportions. This is a small, relatively slender species of Cynisca. Preserved specimens are a uniform light brown dorsally and lighter on the ventral surface| the countershading proceeds within one or two segments just above the lateral sulci. The intersegmental sutures of the dorsal surface are lightened. A few lighter patches appear in the anterolateral region and it is uncertain whether or not these represent artifacts of preservation. The anterior  <span style="color: red;">fused shield</span>  as well as the supralabials are always lighter colored. In contrast, the median azygous shield, the oculars, and the frontal-parietals (and sometimes the occipitals), as well as irregular parts of adjacent shields, are a medium brown, much darker than any other part of the trunk. This pigmentation gives the appearance of a forked dark patch on the head. The dorsal surface of the caudal region IS somewhat darker than that of the trunk and even the ventral portion of the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  is darkened. The cloacal shields may be lighter. The anterior head shields show major fusions. The rostral is barely visible in dorsal view. Posteriorly, it is followed on each side by a large shield that includes the  <span style="color: red;">preocular</span>  supralabials, the  <span style="color: red;">nasal</span>  and the  <span style="color: red;">prefrontal</span>  The diagonally placed oculars are wider than long. A  <span style="color: red;">blind suture</span>  extends from its anterior corner into the  <span style="color: red;">fused shield</span>  A triangular azygous shield lies on the midline. Its anterior tip inserts between the posterior portion of the anterior  <span style="color: red;">fused shield</span> | laterally, it has point contact with the oculars and the transverse posterior edge contacts the fused, relatively small frontal (-parietal) shields. The second supralabial (or first postocular one) is longest at the level of the eye| it extends dorsally to contact the midlateral portion of the frontalparietal shield. The frontal appears to be fused to the parietal, but the compound shield is relatively small and some specimens (MG 722.94b| MHNP 1895.481) show unilateral (or bilateral in MHNP 1897-319) point or broader contact of the enormous  <span style="color: red;">temporal</span>  to the midline. A triangular pair of occipitals (irregular in MG 722.94b) extends anteriorly from the third body annulus almost to the level of the angulus oris. The first postsupralabial is twice as high as long| the second is squarish and is followed dorsally by a second subequal shield which lies below the enormous  <span style="color: red;">temporal</span> -parietal. The  <span style="color: red;">temporal</span>  covers the side of the head anterior to the first dorsal half-annulus and posterior to the first postocular supralabial. In general, the fused head shields occupy the place of the dorsal half of the first two  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  The snout is slightly prognathous and the rostral is clearly visible in ventral view. The large  <span style="color: red;">mental</span>  is narrower posteriorly than anteriorly and is flanked completely by the enormous first  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span>  The anterior sutures of the small second  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span>  extend anteriorly from the junction with the  <span style="color: red;">malars</span>  to the lip. The large and rectangular  <span style="color: red;">malars</span>  are twice as wide as long. A median enlarged  <span style="color: red;">postmental</span>  is followed posteriorly by two  <span style="color: red;">postgenials</span> | all three are flanked by two elongate segments medial to the first  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span>  and  <span style="color: red;">malars</span> | thus a superficial count would give three  <span style="color: red;">postgenials</span>  of the first row and four  <span style="color: red;">postgenials</span>  in the second row. In most specimens, the flanking segments are subdivided so that there are two discrete rows of  <span style="color: red;">postgenials</span>  The ventral segments of the first through sixth  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  are reduced in size| the seventh and eighth swing anteriorly near the midventral line| neither more anterior nor more posterior annuli show this pattern. Some specimens show fusion or other irregularity of ventral annuli in this region. There are 233 to 243  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  from the first segment posterior to the angulus oris up to and including the pore-bearing precloacal row. The dorsal portion of the second to sixth discrete dorsal half-annuli may be narrowed and folded. At midbody an annulus contains  <span style="color: green;">14</span>  from twice as long as wide to squarish, dorsal segments and ten ventral ones, the medial ones 2½ times as wide as long. The cloacal region corresponds to two to three lateral annuli. The  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  bears 18 or 19  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  before a conically oval cap that is more than twice as long as the next annulus and generally includes indications of segmental subdivisions all around the base, but not on the distal tip. A narrowed, but not especially pigmented  <span style="color: red;">autotomy site</span>  occurs on the sixth to seventh postcloacal position. (None of the specimens shows autotomy.) There are seven to eight variably produced round  <span style="color: red;">precloacal pores</span>  each inserted near the posterior edge of one of the segments of the precloacal annulus| those of males bear projecting cores. (The holotype is aberrant in that only three of the eight precloacal segments bear any pores, but these are very well developed.) The pore-bearing row corresponds to the width of the paired ventral segments and to the four medial segments of the six subequal ones covering the crescentic precloacal shield. The postcloacal edge is formed of six to eight segments. The snout is markedly pointed, both in dorsal and in lateral view. At the level of the nostrils, it is half as wide as at the level of the postsupralabials. The  <span style="color: red;">temporal</span>  region is wider than the trunk at the level of the third through eighth annuli. The  <span style="color: red;">preocular</span>  portion of the snout is slightly swollen. The trunk is variably compressed dorsoventrally until the base of the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  where the cross section changes to a vertical oval. The lateral sulci start at the 40th body annulus, indicated anteriorly only by alignment of sutures| at midbody an annulus is less than half the width of an adjacent segment and contains some tiny triangular segments. The dorsal sulcus begins at the same level and is of similar proportions. It continues as a deep groove onto the base of the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  though the intercalated segments drop out at the level of the cloaca. The ventral sulcus is indicated only by an alignment of sutures. (Gans 1987: 46)<br>

Cynisca leucura	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Diagnosis (genus): Generally small and slender species with the anterior trunk dorsoventrally compressed, rounded at midbody, and vertically ovate posterior to the cloacal region (normally at or posterior to autotomy site). Headroundedor variablypointed,usually horizontallyoval.Rostralalwaysdiscrete,but (except for C. williamsi in which in broad contact with the prefrontals), small, and visible only as a tiny triangle in dorsal view. All forms with a band of enlarged (and generally paired) dorsal segments extending posteriorly from the snout to incorporate portions of the second or third body annulus. All specimens with one or even two postsupralabials and a zone of variously fused and enlarged segments in the "postocular" region dorsal to these. A lateral groove, filled with small, intercalated triangular segments, between the first third to half of the body and vent. Dorsal sulcus variably expressed| ventral sulcus, if present, indicated only by alignment of sutures. Median ventral segments generally enlarged. In some species, fused into an azygous medial segmental shield. Males of all species with precloacal pores| females of some species without pores or even secretion cores. All species (but C. williamsi) with a caudal autotomy constriction. Distal tip of original  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  usually regularly segmented, occasionally showing modifications, such as a dorsal hump or inclined array of segments. (Gans 1987: 22)Diagnosis: Two preocular supralabials, preocular and ocular discrete. Nasal and prefrontal fused except for blind suture reaching anteriorly from corner of preocular. Median azygous shield. (Sometimes a pair of segments posterior to the azygous shield on the midline, anterior to the frontals.) Frontals, parietals, and occipitals distinct. Postocular supralabial kept from contact with frontal by large postocular. Two or more medium-size temporals dorsal to first (and second) postsupralabials. Snout generally pointed. <span style="color: green;">3</span>  supralabials and 2 infralabials. First infralabials much wider and slightly longer than mental plus postmental (which are fused in 12% of specimens). Two  <span style="color: red;">rows of postgenials</span> (2-6, 4-11| rarely three rows), each between enlarged malars. 203-252  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span> | 20-30  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  Midbody segments, 12-23 dorsal, 8-16 ventral. Median ventral segments enlarged, paired. 0, 6-13 round precloacal pores. Autotomy site at the 5th to 9th caudal annulus. (Gans 1987: 48)DESCRIPTION (Pattern III): This widely ranging species shows substantial geographic variation. The meristic characters are summarized in tables  <span style="color: green;">1</span>  2, <span style="color: green;">3</span>  4, and 5. Figures 25 and 8 show the views of the  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  figure 13 the ventral surface of the cloacal region, figure 11 the segment proportions, as well as the pattern at midbody, figure 14 lateral view of  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  and caudal region, figure 26 a lateral view of the  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  with the mouth open| figure 6 gives the body proportions. This is a large species of Cynisca. Specimens are a uniform dark bluish-brown dorsally and lighter on the ventral surface| the countershading proceeds by general fading within one or two segments just ventral to the lateral sulci (though a very few specimens, such as RMNH 18672, show a checkerboard drop out of pigment) and the midventral segments may be very light. However, even the ventral surface of most specimens is pigmented, which is particularly obvious on the ventral surface of the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  All or part of the chin tends to be unpigmented as may be the first supralabial| some specimens show a lightened partial neck band near the second and third annuli. In many specimens one sees the collagen fibers of the extracolumellar attachment as a light area deep to the large infralabials. Some precloacal segments may be colorless and there may be a narrow nonpigmented midventral streak down the center of the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  Pigmentation of segments tends to be uniform, except that the anterior half of each segment is darker (which is more obvious on the ventral surface). The dorsal surfaces of the  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  and caudal region are slightly darker than the trunk| the dorsal caudal cap is darkest. One or two autotomy annuli may be markedly darkened. The anterior  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  shields show fusions only in the loss of the anterior sutures between nasals and prefrontals| however, there is notable variation in segmental proportions and marked asymmetry. The rostral is visible as a small triangle in dorsal view. Posteriorly, it is followed on each side by a very large nasal-prefrontal, though a horizontal blind suture extends into this shield from the anterior tip of the preocular. A pentagonal azygous shield of variable size lies along the midline between the fused nasal-prefrontal shields. (In a few specimens from Achimota the azygous shows a partial midline split from the posterior edge. The shield is subdivided into three smaller shields, effectively intercalating an additional pair of "prefrontals" back of the azygous that are in contact with the supraoculars, in CG 4736 and 4763.) Laterally, this shield is excluded from contact with the ocular by the quadrangular supraocular (azygously fused to the ocular in CG 3998, to the frontal and postocular in CG 4746), which keeps the prefrontal from contacting the frontal. The anterior edge of each frontal extends most anteriorly at the line where the azygous median shield contacts the supraoculars and slopes posteriorly from here to contact the oculars and postoculars along which it gradually narrows to asymmetrical contact with the parietals. The latter widen posteriorly along the postocular and narrow along contact with a  <span style="color: red;">temporal</span>  to join a pair of small occipitals, that derive from the median segments of the third body annulus, or of an intercalated dorsal half-annulus (lying between  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  two and three). There are two preocular supralabials| the second is larger and kept from contact with the prefrontal by the rectangular preocular. The small polygonal ocular is diagonally placed with the large eye visible in its center. The third supralabial is enormous and extends dorsally along the posteroventral side of the ocular to contact the ventral edge of the large postocular. A slightly enlarged first postsupralabial and a smaller second one form the base of the  <span style="color: red;">temporal</span>  region. A large  <span style="color: red;">temporal</span>  shield lies dorsal to the first postsupralabial and two small ones dorsal to the second. An intercalated dorsal half-annulus follows after the first dorsal half-annulus corresponding to body annulus four. The zone of the first two postsupralabials extends upward to form the  <span style="color: red;">temporal</span>  region, the occipitals being part of the second (an intercalated half-annulus) or the third dorsal half-annulus. The zone of enlargment corresponds to the dorsal portions of two to three  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  However, the  <span style="color: red;">temporal</span>  and parietal-occipital regions of this species are highly variable, and show very irregular segmentation with differences common within samples and major asymmetries in most specimens. The snout is slightly prognathous and the rostral is clearly visible in ventral view. The mental is narrower posteriorly than anteriorly| it is generally followed by an elongate postmental (see section on Geographic Variation) and both are flanked completely by the enormous first infralabials. The anterior sutures of the small second infralabials extend anteriorly from the malar junction to the lip. The enlarged trapezoidal malars enclose the posterior portion of the first and all of the second postgenial row, the first containing 2 to 6 segments and the latter 4 to 11| often the segments medial to the malars are elongate and undivided, whereas a few specimens show additional subdivision leading to a pattern resembling three postgenial rows. The lateral postgenials lie posterior to the first infralabials. The ventral segments of the first Six to seven  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  are reduced in size, by the 10th annulus the medial ones are squarish and by the 20th they are twice as wide as long. There are 203 to 252  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  from the first segment posterior to the angulus oris up to and including the pore-bearing precloacal row. The dorsal portion of the second to eighth anteriormost annuli may be narrowed and folded and a crescentic dorsal half-annulus lies intercalated between  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  three and four (see above), whereas there tends to be an intercalated or spiral annulus within the first ten  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  and some segmental irregularity in the cloacal region. At midbody an annulus contains 12 to 23 dorsal segments, the medial ones twice as long as wide, whereas the medial segments of the 8 to 16 ventral ones are 2-2½ times as wide as long. The cloacal region corresponds to two to four (generally three to four) lateral annuli with asymmetries common. The  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  bears 20 to 30  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  before a conically oval cap that is longer than the next annulus and generally includes indications of segmental subdivisions around the base, but not on the distal tip. A narrowed, often more densely pigmented, autotomy site occurs on the fifth to ninth postcloacal position. There are 6 to 13 (generally 8 to 11) large round precloacal pores (in a continuous or medially interrupted row) on the posterior edge of the precloacal segments (a single specimen from Bobo Dioulasso lacks pores)| projecting cores are each inserted into the center of one of the small segments lying anterior to the precloacal shield. The pore-bearing row corresponds to the width of the six midventral segments and exceeds the width of the four enlarged medial segments of the eight to ten covering the crescentic precloacal shield. The medial pair of segments tends to be longer than the more lateral ones and may extend into the pore-bearing row, separating it by the insertion of a triangular wedge. The postcloacal edge is formed of 7 to 11 (generally 8 to 10) segments. The snout is more pointed in lateral than in dorsal view. At the level of the nostrils it is half as wide as at the level of the postsupralabials. The  <span style="color: red;">temporal</span>  region may be slightly wider than the trunk at the level of the third through eighth annuli and the back of the  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  may be slightly constricted. The trunk is rounded anteriorly and variably compressed dorsoventrally thereafter until the base of the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  where the cross section changes to a vertical oval. The lateral sulci start near the 20th body annulus and extend just beyond the level of the cloaca. Anteriorly, they are indicated only by alignment of sutures| at midbody, they contain multiple, regular intercalated segments. The middorsal sulcus begins near the 10th annulus, but only becomes significantly widened near the 60th. It is narrower than the lateral ones and only a tiny triangular segment on the posterior half of each annulus. It continues as a deep groove onto the base of the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  though the intercalated segments drop out at the level of the cloaca. The ventral sulcus is indicated only by an alignment of sutures. (Gans 1987: 48)<br>

Cynisca liberiensis	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	DIAGNOSIS: Preocular supralabials, nasal and prefrontal fused, with a blind suture entering fused shield from anterior corner of ocular. Ocular discrete (quadratic, diagonally placed). Frontal and parietal fused (relatively small). One or two pairs of distinct occipitals. Enormous first postocular supralabial in broad contact with frontal-parietal. Large temporal lies dorsal to large first and smaller second postsupralabials. Snout generally pointed. 2 supralabials and 2 infralabials. Mental and first infralabials enormous. 2 rows of up to 4 postgenials each between enlarged malars. 217-262 body annuli| 21-24 caudal annuli. Midbody segments, 12-16 dorsal, 8-10 ventral. Median ventral segments enlarged, paired. 6 or 8 round precloacal pores in males, none in females. Autotomy site at the 6th to 9th caudal annulus. (Gans 1987: 53)DESCRIPTION (Pattern XII): The meristic characters are summarized in table 6. Figures 27 and 9 show views of the head, figure 13 the ventral surface of the cloacal region, figure 11 the segment proportions as well as the pattern at midbody, figure 15 lateral view of tail and caudal region| figure 6 gives the body 6 proportions. This is a small, relatively slender species of Cynisca. Preserved specimens are a uniform brown dorsally, some specimens showing mottling of the dorsal segments, and a lighter pigmentation on the ventral surface| the countershading proceeds within one or two segments just above the lateral sulci. The dorsal surface of the caudal region is somewhat darker than that of the trunk and even the ventral portion of the tail is darkened. The cloacal shields may be lighter and some parts of the ventral region may show the pigment dropping out by segments (checkerboard pattern). The anterior head shields show major fusions. The rostral is barely visible in dorsal view. Posteriorly, it is followed on each side by a large shield that includes the preocular supralabials, the nasal, and the prefrontal. The diagonally placed oculars are wider than long (but the eye of preserved specimens often appears to be bisected by their posterior suture). A blind suture extends from its anterior corner into the fused shield. The suture between the large shield and frontals forms an anteriorly pointing, shallow V on the head. The frontal-parietal shields are relatively large. One of two pairs of rectangular occipitals extends anteriorly to the level of the midregion of the first postsupralabial. The second supralabial (or first postocular one) is longest at the level of the eye| it extends dorsally from the lip to contact the widest portion of the frontal-parietal shield. The first postsupralabial is twice as high as long| the second is squarish and followed dorsally by a second subequal one, which lies below the large temporal. The temporal covers the side of the head anterior to the first dorsal half-annulus and posterior to the first postocular supralabial. In general, the fused head shields occupy the place of the dorsal half of the first two body annuli. The snout is slightly prognathous and the rostral is clearly visible in ventral view. The large mental is narrower posteriorly than anteriorly and flanked completely by the enormous first infralabials. The first postgenials may be fused or discrete (Brongersma, 1935). The anterior sutures of the small second infralabials extend from the junction with the malars anteriorly to the lip. The enlarged and rectangular malars are of variable proportions. There are two to four small postgenials in the first (IRSNB 2005 and USNM 24294 show an enlarged median one in the first) row and four to six in the second one. The ventral segments of the first six body annuli are reduced in size| the seventh and eighth swing anteriorly near the midventral line| neither more anterior nor more posterior annuli show this pattern. Some specimens show fusion or other irregularity of ventral annuli in this region. There are 217-262 body annuli, from the first segment posterior to the angulus oris up to and including the pore-bearing precloacal row. The dorsal portion of the second to the sixth discrete dorsal half-annuli may be narrowed and folded. At midbody an annulus contains 12 to 16 dorsal segments (generally 14), from twice as long as wide to squarish, and 8 or 10 ventral ones, the medial segments 2½ times as wide as long. The cloacal region corresponds to two to four lateral annuli. The tail bears 21 to 24 caudal annuli before a conically oval cap occurs that is more than twice as long as the next annulus and includes faint segmental impressions along the base, but not on the distal tip. A narrowed, but relatively poorly defined autotomy site occurs on the sixth to ninth postcloacal position. (Four of 19 specimens have broken tails.) There are six to eight variably produced round cored precloacal pores in the males| the females have none. The pore-bearing row corresponds to the width of the paired ventral segments and to the two to four enlarged medial segments of the six covering the crescentic precloacal shield. The postcloacal edge is formed of six to eight segments. The snout is markedly pointed, both in dorsal and in lateral view. At the level of the nostrils it is half as wide as at the level of the postsupralabials. The temporal region is wider than the trunk at the level of the third through eighth annuli. The trunk is variably compressed dorsoventrally to the base of the tail where the cross section changes to a vertical oval. The lateral sulci start between the 10th and 20th body annulus and are indicated anteriorly only by alignment of sutures| at midbody an annulus is less than half the width of an adjacent segment and contains some tiny triangular segments. The dorsal sulcus begins at the 50th to 60th body annulus and is of similar proportions. It continues as a deep groove onto the base of the tail, though the intercalated segments drop out at the level of the cloaca. The ventral sulcus is indicated only by an alignment of sutures.

(Gans 1987: 55) DESCRIPTION (Pattern V): The meristic characters are summarized in table 4. Figures 28 and 9 show views of the head, figure 13 the ventral surface of the cloacal region, figure 11 the segment proportions as well as the pattern at midbody| figure 6 gives the body proportions. This is a small, relatively slender species of Cynisca. Preserved specimens are a uniform light brown dorsally and lighter on the ventral surface| the countershading proceeds within one or two segments just above the lateral sulci. The intersegmental sutures of the dorsal surface are lightened. The dorsal pigmentation is mottled and emphasizes the anterior centers of dorsal segments. The dorsal surfaces of the posterior quarter of the trunk and the caudal region are somewhat darker than those of the anterior trunk and even the ventral portion of the tail is darkened. The cloacal shields may be lighter. The anterior head shields show major fusions. The rostral is faintly visible in dorsal view. Posteriorly, it is followed on each side by a large shield that includes the  <span style="color: red;">first  <span style="color: red;">preocular</span>  supralabial</span>  the  <span style="color: red;">nasal</span>  the  <span style="color: red;">preocular</span>  and the  <span style="color: red;">prefrontal</span>  The  <span style="color: red;">diagonally placed</span>  <span style="color: red;">ocular</span>  is wider than long. A  <span style="color: red;">blind suture</span>  extends from the anterior corner of the second  <span style="color: red;">preocular</span>  supralabial into the  <span style="color: red;">fused shield</span>  A quadrangular azygous shield lies on the midline. Its anterior tip inserts between the  <span style="color: red;">prefrontal</span>  portion of the  <span style="color: red;">fused shield</span>  and its convex posterior edge between the fused, relatively narrow frontal (- <span style="color: red;">parietal</span> ) shields. The anterior frontal edge flares sharply from the midline to reach the oculars and then gradually narrows to asymmetrical contact with the irregularly shaped occipitals, which widen posteriorly to meet the first dorsal half-annulus. Their anterior tips just reach the level of the middle of the first postsupralabials. The large first  <span style="color: red;">postocular</span>  supralabial extends dorsally to contact the anteroventral portion of the  <span style="color: red;">postocular</span> (- <span style="color: red;">parietal</span> ) shield. The  <span style="color: red;">frontals</span>  appear to be fused to the  <span style="color: red;">parietal</span>  but the shield is relatively small and some specimens show unilateral or bilateral point or broader contact of the enormous  <span style="color: red;">postocular</span>  to the midline, as well as to the first and second (by partial fusion with shields of the first) dorsal half-annuli. The first  <span style="color: red;">postsupralabial</span>  is twice as long as high and the second is significantly smaller and squarish| both are followed dorsally by a medium-size temporal. The posterior aspect of the enormous  <span style="color: red;">postocular</span> (- <span style="color: red;">parietal</span> ) that covers the side of the head anterior to the dorsal half-annuli is irregular. Its posterior portion may be divided off (asymmetrically) as another temporal, or show variable fusion with segments of the first annulus. Partly subdivided shields and blind sutures are common. The annular arrangement is both irregular and asymmetrical and there seem to be three dorsal halfannuli involved in the formation of the region of enlarged shields. The snout is slightly prognathous and the rostral is clearly visible in ventral view. The large  <span style="color: red;">mental</span>  is slightly narrower posteriorly than anteriorly and flanked completely by the enormous longer first infralabials. The anterior sutures of the small second infralabials extend at a slight angle from the junction with the malar to the lip. A row of four to five  <span style="color: red;">postgenials</span> (only the medial two lying posterior to the  <span style="color: red;">mental</span> ) lies anterior and medial to the  <span style="color: red;">malars</span> | a second row of  <span style="color: red;">postgenials</span>  contains four to Six segments and lies lateral to the  <span style="color: red;">malars</span>  The ventral segments of the first five  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  are reduced in size. Some specimens show fusion or other irregularity of ventral annuli in the region of 10 to 12 before the fully widened midventral segments appear. There are 220 to 237  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  from the first segment posterior to the angulus oris up to and including the pore-bearing  <span style="color: red;">precloacal</span>  row. The dorsal portion of the second to sixth discrete dorsal half-annuli may be narrowed and folded and preceded by one crescentic dorsal half-annulus. At midbody an annulus contains 11 to 15, twice as long as wide, dorsal segments and 10 to 13 ventral ones| the medial segments are 2½ times as wide as long. The cloacal region corresponds to two to five lateral annuli. The tail bears 22 to 26  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  before a conically oval cap. The last annulus is markedly shortened and the unsegmented cap only slightly longer than an anterior caudal annulus. A narrowed, but not especially pigmented autotomy site occurs at the sixth to eighth  <span style="color: red;">postcloacal</span>  position. (Two of the 17 specimens show autotomy.) There are 10 to 12 variably produced round  <span style="color: red;">precloacal</span>  pores, each inserted in the posterior edge of  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">1</span> </span> </span> </span> </span> </span> </span> </span> </span> </span> </span>  of the 12 segments of the  <span style="color: red;">precloacal</span>  annulus| those of males bear projecting cores. The pore-bearing row corresponds to the width of the two to four medial ventral segments and to the full width of the flared crescentic  <span style="color: red;">precloacal</span>  shield, which is covered by six subequal plus two smaller lateral segments. The  <span style="color: red;">postcloacal</span>  edge is formed of six to eight segments. The snout is markedly pointed, more in dorsal than in lateral view. At the level of the nostrils it is half as wide as at the level of the postsupralabials. The temporal region is wider than the trunk at the level of the third through eighth annuli. The trunk is rounded anteriorly and variably compressed dorsoventrally thereafter until the base of the tail where the cross section changes to faintly oval vertically. The lateral sulci start at the 20th body annulus, being indicated anteriorly only by alignment of sutures| at midbody an annulus is only a fraction of the width of an adjacent segment and contains some tiny triangular segments. The dorsal sulcus is marked near the 70th annulus and is of similar proportions. It continues as a deep groove onto the base of the tail, though the intercalated segments drop out at the level of the cloaca. The ventral sulcus is indicated only by an alignment of sutures.

Cynisca nigeriensis	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Original Diagnosis: A medium sized species of the genus Cynisca showing major fusions of the head shields, namely fusion of the 1st and 2nd supralabials with the  <span style="color: red;">nasal</span> ,prefrontal, frontal, preocular, and ocular shields. A pair of large elongate postfrontals, together forming the shape of an armorial shield, the postfrontals being sometimes of irregular shape and size.

(Gans 1987: 57)DESCRIPTION (Pattern IX): The meristic characters are summarized in table 2. Figures 29 and 9 show views of the head, figure 13 the ventral surface of the cloacal region, figure 12 the segment proportions as well as the pattern at midbody, figure 15 lateral view of tail and caudal region| figure 6 gives the body proportions. This is a small, relatively slender species of Cynisca. Preserved specimens are colored a uniform brown dorsally, but are slightly lighter on the ventral surface. The pigment density increases posteriorly and is greatest on the first half of the tail. There is some tendency to checkerboard dropout of pigment in the cloacal region| however, the ventral pigmentation also becomes patchy on individual segments. The anterior head shields show major fusions. The small rostral is barely visible as a triangle in dorsal view. It is followed posteriorly by enormous paired shields that cover the bulbously swollen  <span style="color: red;">snout</span>  and apparently include the regions occupied by the  <span style="color: red;">preocular supralabials</span>  nasals, oculars, preoculars, and prefrontals| the vertical posterior suture of these shields appears to bisect the position of the eye in one specimen, in which the integument appeared translucent. The large second supralabial (or first postocular one) extends dorsally to wide contact with the lateral edges of the trapezoidal frontal and posterodorsally with the large  <span style="color: red;">parietal</span>  The latter extends laterally to contact the first postsupralabial, which in turn extends posterodorsally to contact the third body annulus and is much higher than its length along the postlabial edge. The posterior  <span style="color: red;">parietal</span>  edge contacts the intercalated dorsal half-annulus posterior to the third body annulus. A small triangular  <span style="color: red;">occipital</span>  lies medial to the posterior portion of the  <span style="color: red;">parietal</span> | the frontal and the  <span style="color: red;">occipital</span>  may restrict or eliminate contact of the  <span style="color: red;">parietal</span>  with the midline. The occipitals are azygously irregular. Three of the specimens lack occipitals (have them  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">fused</span> </span>  with the parietals)| in two others, there is an  <span style="color: red;">occipital</span>  on one side only. The second and third postsupralabials are small and irregular, as are the segments dorsal to the third, up to the midline. Most of these and the intercalated dorsal half-annulus cover the posterior portion of the head and face posteriorly along the deep nuchal constriction, indicating that only the anteriorly and dorsally directed shields are  <span style="color: green;">enlarged</span>  The dorsal portions of the first three annuli are involved in cephalic coverage. The  <span style="color: red;">snout</span>  is prognathous and the rostral is far more obvious in ventral than in dorsal view. The lower jaw is not particularly deeply inserted into the  <span style="color: green;">bulbous</span>  <span style="color: red;">snout</span>  which is almost twice as wide as high. In ventral view, the  <span style="color: red;">mental</span>  is narrower than the first infralabial, and the area of the latter is greater. The anterior suture of the second infralabial extends anteriorly at an angle from the junction with the  <span style="color: red;">malars</span>  to the lip. The suture defining the posterior edges of the very large  <span style="color: red;">mental</span>  and the flanking first infralabials swings anteromedially so that the  <span style="color: green;">enlarged</span>  pentagonal  <span style="color: red;">malars</span>  generally lie lateral to the posterior portion of the first and all of the second row of small paired postgenials. Each postgenial row contains four (rarely fewer than three in the first and rarely five in the second) segments. The lateral postgenials on each side lie posterior to the infralabials, as do the lateral portions of the medial postgenial. The postmalars are slightly  <span style="color: green;">enlarged</span>  The segments of the gular region are slightly reduced in size and the midventral segments of the seventh annulus show the first indication of widening of the medial segments. An intercalated dorsal half-annulus lies near the eighth annulus. There are 225 to 242  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  from the first segments posterior to the angulus oris up to and including the pore-bearing precloacal row. The dorsal portions of the seventh to eighth  <span style="color: green;">discrete</span>  dorsal half-annuli are narrowed and deeply folded. At midbody, an annulus contains eight to ten (generally ten) dorsal segments 1½-2 times as wide and seven or nine (generally eight) ventral segments, the medial ones about 2½ times as wide as long. The cloacal region corresponds to three to four  <span style="color: red;">lateral annuli</span>  The narrowed tail bears 20 to 22  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  before a conically oval end, which is generally twice or more as long as the last annulus and bears faintly indented sutures near its anterior edge. An autotomy site is marked at the fifth to seventh postcloacal annulus. It is always well defined, both tail and autotomy annulus being slightly narrowed and more intensely pigmented. Four of 15 specimens have a broken tail. There are either ten or no variably produced precloacal pores, each inserted into the middle of the posterior edge of one of the ten narrow median segments of the precloacal annulus (only nine in AMNH 102413). This set corresponds to the width of the  <span style="color: green;">enlarged</span>  midventral segments and precedes the edge of the bow-shaped precloacal shield. The shield consists of four very wide median segments plus a pair of narrower and shorter flanking segments. The narrow postcloacal edge is formed of eight to ten segments. The trunk is generally slightly wider than high| however, it becomes rounded and slightly higher than wide just posterior to the cloacal region. The tail is of smaller diameter than the trunk. The caudal tip forms a distinct vertical oval in cross section. The lateral sulci start at the level of the 20th body annulus, are filled with small triangular segments, and at midbody are approximately as wide as half of one of the flanking segments. Anteriorly (for the first 60 or so annuli), the middorsal sulcus is indicated only by alignment of intersegmental sutures. At midbody, it is almost as wide as the lateral ones and it continues as a depressed groove onto the base of the tail. The ventral sulcus is only indicated by alignment of sutures.

Cynisca oligopholis	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Original description: Boulenger 1906: 201DIAGNOSIS: Preocular supralabials, nasal and prefrontal fused, with a blind suture entering the fused shield from the anterior corner of ocular. Oculars discrete (large and rectangular, diagonally placed). A small median azygous shield contacts the oculars. Frontalparietal-occipitals fused into narrow median shields. First postocular supralabial contacts frontal shield. Enormous temporal extends posterodorsally from the second supralabial to fused shields. Head bulbous. 2 supralabials and 2 infralabials. Mental and first infralabials enormous. Postgenials only slightly enlarged. Malars enlarged, but most posterior chin segments subequal. 224-240 body annuli| 23-25 caudal annuli. Midbody segments, 10 dorsal, 8 ventral. Median ventral segments enlarged, paired. 8-11 precloacal pores. Autotomy site lies at 10th to 13th caudal annulus. (Gans 1987: 59)DESCRIPTION (Pattern VII): Meristic characters are summarized in table 7. Figures 30 and 9 show views of the head, figure 13 the ventral surface of the cloacal region, figure 12 the segment proportions as well as the pattern at midbody, figure 15 lateral view of tail and caudal region| figure 6 gives the body proportions. This is a small, relatively slender species of Cynisca. Preserved specimens are uniformly pale brown dorsally and lighter on the ventral surface| the countershading is gradual and starts just above the level of the lateral sulcus. The dorsal pigmentation extends anteriorly onto the large head shields, though the tip of the snout and the chin appear lighter colored. The pigment density is greatest on the neck and dorsal surface of the tail. The pale ventral color extends from the chin across the anterior 15 percent of the trunk and the ventral surface becomes darker posteriorly. The cloacal shield and immediate precloacal rows may also be unpigmented. The anterior head shields show major fusions. The rostral is not visible in dorsal view. The anteriormost portion of the head is covered on each side by a large shield that includes the region otherwise occupied by the preocular supralabials, the nasal, and the prefrontal. The diagonally placed ocular is semirectangular, much wider than long and a small blind suture extends anteriorly from its anterior corner. The triangular, azygous median shield contacts the anterior fused shields along the midline, the oculars laterally, and the medial portions of the anterior edge of the fused frontal-parietal-occipital shields posteriorly. The second supralabial (or first postocular one) is shorter ventrally than dorsally, but extends dorsally to broad contact with the frontal-parietal-occipital shield that forms a narrow strip from the azygous shield to the anterior edge of the first dorsal half-annulus (or third body annulus). Posterior to the second supralabial lies the enormous temporal shield, which occupies the position of the first postsupralabial and then extends dorsally and posteriorly around the second one to provide a single shield lateral to the frontal-parietaloccipital shield, anterior to the second postsupralabial segment and the irregular first dorsal half-annulus. In general, the fused head shields occupy the place of the dorsal half of the first two body annuli. The snout is slightly prognathous and the small rostral is clearly visible in ventral view. The large mental is slightly narrower posteriorly than anteriorly| its sides are entirely flanked by the enormous first infralabials. The anterior suture of the second infralabial extends at an angle from the junction with the malars to the lip. The small second infralabials medially contact the slightly enlarged malars| the left malar flanks only the second postgenial row, whereas the right malar flanks both rows. The two rows consist of variably arranged postgenial segments that extend laterally beyond the limits of the mental. The segments of the first four annuli in the gular region are slightly smaller than more posterior segments and there may be irregular fusion of annuli here. There are 224 to 240 body annuli, from the first segment posterior to the angulus oris up to and including the pore-bearing pre-cloacal row. The dorsal portions of the seventh to eighth discrete dorsal half-annuli are narrowed and deeply folded. At midbody an annulus contains ten dorsal segments (always longer than wide) and eight ventral segments, the medial ones each 2½ times as wide as long. The cloacal region corresponds to two to three lateral annuli. The tail bears 23 to 25 caudal annuli before an oval end, which is generally two or more times as long as the next anterior annulus and bears faintly indented sutures only near its anterior edge. A slightly narrowed, but not differentially pigmented autotomy annulus is faintly visible between the 10th to 1 3th postcloacal position (almost 40% of the available specimens show broken tails). There are eight to ten variably produced, round precloacal pores, each inserted into the middle of the posterior edge of the narrow median segments of the precloacal annulus. This set and the cloacal slit are each narrower than the paired median segments of the more anterior body annuli. The crescentic precloacal shield is covered by four large segments that are flanked by two smaller triangular segments. The narrow postcloacal edge is formed of eight to ten segments. The head is slightly dorsoventrally compressed. The trunk is generally rounded down to the midbody region where it becomes slightly flattened dorsoventrally. The transition from horizontal to vertical compression occurs near the level of the autotomy annulus and the caudal tip is vertically oval in cross section. The lateral sulci start at the level of the 14th body annulus. At midbody they are filled with small triangular segments and are approximately as wide as a quarter of one of the flanking segments. Anteriorly (for the first 50 or so body annuli), the middorsal sulcus is indicated only by an alignment of intersegmental sutures. At midbody, it is almost as wide as the lateral ones and continues as a depressed groove onto the base of the tail until the autotomy annulus. The ventral sulcus is only indicated by an alignment of intersegmental sutures. (Gans 1987: 59)<br>

Cynisca rouxae	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	DIAGNOSIS: Two preocular supralabials, nasal, prefrontal, preocular, and ocular discrete. A small, median azygous shield. Frontal, postocular, parietal, and occipital distinct. Postocular supralabial kept from contact with frontal by postocular. Two medium-size temporals dorsal to first (and second) postsupralabials. Snout generally pointed. 3 Supralabials and 2 infralabials. First infralabials much wider and slightly longer than mental. 2 rows of 4 postgenials each between enlarged malars. <span style="color: red;">197-207 body annuli</span> | <span style="color: red;">22 caudal annuli</span>  <span style="color: red;">midbody segments</span>  14-15 dorsal, 12-14 ventral. Median ventral segments slightly enlarged, paired. 6 round precloacal pores. Autotomy site at the 6th to 7th caudal annulus. (Gans 1987: 61)DESCRIPTION (Pattern IV): Meristic characters are summarized in table 5. Figures 31 and 10 show views of the head, figure 13 the ventral surface of the cloacal region, figure 12 the segment proportions, as well as the pattern at midbody, figure 15 lateral view of tail and caudal region| figure 6 gives the body proportions. This is a small, relatively slender species of Cynisca. The faded types are a uniform, light brown dorsally and lighter on the ventral surface| the countershading proceeds within one or two segments just above the lateral sulci. The dorsal surface of the caudal region is somewhat darker than that of the trunk and even the ventral portion of the tail is pigmented. The caudal cap is darkest. The anterior head shields show no major fusions. The rostral is barely visible in dorsal view. Posteriorly, it is followed on each side by a very large nasal shield that occupies the anterior extent of the snout. Along the dorsal midline, this is followed by a large rectangular prefrontal that forms a rounded, posteriorly concave suture with the nasal. A small, shield-shaped azygous shield lies along the midline between and posterior to the prefrontals. Laterally, this shield is excluded from contact with the ocular by the anterior aspect of the frontal, which broadly contacts the prefrontal, and by the point contact between the prefrontal and the postocular. The anterior edge of the frontal flares sharply from the midline to reach the oculars and then gradually narrows to asymmetrical contact with the parietals. The latter widen posteriorly to meet a pair of small occipitals, that derive from the median segments of the first dorsal half-annulus (pertaining to body annulus three?). There are two preocular supralabials| the second is larger and both are kept from contact with the prefrontal by the rectangular preocular. The ocular is rectangular and diagonally placed with the eye visible near the ventralmost apex. The third supralabial is enormous and extends dorsally along the posteroventral side of the ocular to contact the ventral edge of the large postocular. A slightly enlarged first postsupralabial and a smaller second one form the base of the temporal region. A small temporal shield lies dorsal to the second and two large ones follow each other dorsally to cover the bulging side of the head up to the medial row of shields, lying anterior to the first dorsal half-annulus. The back of the zone of enlarged shields is irregular and asymmetrical in the holotype. The occipitals are clearly part of the third dorsal half-annulus, though at the dorsal midline their posterior edge lies anterior to the back of this annulus at the level of the mouth. However, an intercalated dorsal half-annulus becomes wedge-shaped and disappears ventrally some two segments above the level of the mouth. The zone of enlargement corresponds to the dorsal portions of the first three body annuli. The snout is slightly prognathous and the rostral is clearly visible in ventral view. The mental is narrower posteriorly than anteriorly and is flanked completely by the enormous first infralabials. The anterior sutures of the small second infralabials extend anteriorly from the malar junction to the lip. The enlarged trapezoidal malars enclose the posterior portion of the first and all of the second postgenial row, each containing four segments| the lateral postgenials lie posterior to the first infralabials. The ventral segments of the first six body annuli are reduced in size, and the more posterior medial segments widen very gradually. There are 197 to 207 body annuli, from the first segment posterior to the angulus oris up to and including the pore-bearing precloacal row. The dorsal portion of the second to eighth discrete dorsal half-annuli may be narrowed and folded and two crescentic dorsal half-annuli lie intercalated between annuli two and three (see above). At midbody an annulus contains 14-15 twice as long as wide dorsal segments and 12 to 14 ventral ones| the medial segments are 2-2½ times as wide as long. The cloacal region corresponds to two to three lateral annuli. The tail (of the one specimen with an entire tail) bears  <span style="color: red;">22 caudal annuli</span>  before a conically oval cap that is more than twice as long as the next annulus and generally includes indications of segmental subdivisions all around the base, but not on the distal tip. A narrowed, but not especially pigmented autotomy site occurs on the seventh postcloacal position. (One of the types has a partially healed, autotomized tail.) There are six large round precloacal pores on the posterior edge of the precloacal segments| the holotype shows narrow projecting cores each inserted into the center of the edge of one of six small segments lying anterior to the precloacal shield. The pore-bearing row corresponds to the width of the four midventral segments and exceeds the width of the four enlarged medial segments of the six to seven covering the crescentic precloacal shield. The postcloacal edge is formed of seven to ten segments. The snout is more pointed in dorsal than in lateral view. At the level of the nostrils, it is half as wide as at the level of the postsupralabials. The temporal region is wider than the trunk at the level of the third through eighth annuli and the back of the head is slightly constricted. The trunk is rounded anteriorly and variably compressed dorsoventrally thereafter until the base of the tail where the cross section changes to a vertical oval. The lateral sulci start near the 20th body annulus, being indicated anteriorly only by alignment of sutures| at midbody an annulus is less than half the width of an adjacent segment and contains regular intercalated segments. The middorsal sulcus begins near the 60th annulus and is narrower than the lateral ones. It continues as a deep groove onto the base of the tail, though the intercalated segments drop out at the level of the cloaca. The ventral sulcus is indicated only by an alignment of sutures.

Cynisca schaeferi	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	DIAGNOSIS: Preocular supralabials, nasal, prefrontal, preocular, and ocular fused, with shallow blind suture entering a shallowly delimited fused shield from above the level of the eye. Subrectangular frontal, parietal, and pentagonal occipital discrete. First postocular supralabial very large, in contact with frontal. A single trapezoidal temporal dorsal to the first postsupralabial, followed by one smaller one lateral to the occipital. Head pointed. 2 supralabials and 2 infralabials. Mental fused with first infralabials anteriorly| a large postgenial flanked by one or two small segments| enlarged rectangular malar. 241-252 body annuli| 25-26 caudal annuli. Midbody segments, 12 dorsal, 10 ventral. Median ventral segments enlarged, paired. 12 or 0 precloacal pores. Autotomy site at 13th caudal annulus. (Gans 1987: 63)DESCRIPTION (Pattern XVI): Meristic characters are summarized in table 1. Figures 32 and 10 show views of the head, figure 13 the ventral surface of the cloacal region, figure 12 the segment proportions, as well as the pattern at midbody, figure 15 lateral view of tail and caudal region| figure 6 gives the body 6 proportions. This is a relatively large, fairly stout species of Cynisca. Preserved specimens are faded, but there are traces of pigment, suggesting that the tail was darkened. The anterior head shields show major fusions. The rostral is relatively small and barely visible in dorsal view. Enormous paired shields cover the anteriormost portion of the bulbously swollen snout and apparently include the regions occupied by the preocular supralabials, the nasals, the preoculars, the oculars, and the prefrontals| the vertical posterior suture of these shields either bisects or follows just posterior to the position of the eye. A blind suture extends anteriorly into this compound shield on each side from the anteriorly convex frontal suture. One specimen (SMF 30263) shows a tiny (ocular?) shield on the left side at the site where the posterior suture of the compound shield sends a tip between the large supralabial and the frontal. The enormous second supralabial (or first postocular one) extends dorsally to broad horizontal contact with the parallel-sided frontal. The irregular parietal is also parallelsided, but slightly narrower than the frontal. Laterally, it is in contact with the first and largest of the irregular temporals that extends dorsally from contact with the first and second (which may be fused) postsupralabial. The temporal may be vertically subdivided (azygously). It is followed posteriorly by the segments of the third body annulus that extend from the third postsupralabial to reach the occipital which tends to be slightly shorter laterally than at the midline. In general, the fused head shields occupy the place of the dorsal half of the first three body annuli. All specimens show a partial dorsal half-annulus in the nuchal region between the occipital and the dorsal portion of the fourth body annulus. The snout is prognathous and the rostral is clearly visible in ventral view. The lower jaw is not particularly deeply inserted into the bulbous snout, which is almost twice as wide as high and swollen up to the level of the eye. In ventral view, the mental is narrower than the first infralabials, and the anterior sutures separating them do not reach the lip. The suture defining the posterior edges of the very large mental and the flanking first infralabials crosses the chin at the anterior level of the second infralabials, swinging anteriorly in the middle so that the enlarged malars generally correspond to the posterior portion of the median enlarged postgenial, which is flanked by one or two smaller segments on each side and may be posteriorly divided. The ventral segments of the gular region (first five body annuli) are slightly reduced in size and the ventral segments of the following annuli swing slightly anteriorly. There are 241 to 252 body annuli, from the first segments posterior to the angulus oris up to and including the pore-bearing precloacal row. The dorsal portions of the seventh to eighth discrete dorsal half-annuli are narrowed and deeply folded. At midbody an annulus contains 12 dorsal segments, three times longer than wide, and 10 ventral ones, the medial ones more than 2½ times as wide as long. The cloacal region corresponds to three lateral annuli. The tail bears 25 to 26 a caudal annuli before a conically pointed end, which is more than twice as long as the last annulus and bears no indented sutures. An autotomy site is marked at the 13th caudal annulus. It is always well defined, being slightly narrowed and (perhaps) more intensely pigmented. None of the specimens had a broken tail. There are 12 or 0 variably produced precloacal pores, each inserted into the middle of a small segment| these 12 segments form a precloacal semicircle that occupies the midventral portion, but separates laterally from the precloacal annulus. The specimens lacking pores also lack discrete segments of this row. This set is wider than the enlarged and paired midventral segments of the preceding annuli and reaches laterally to surround the anterior edge of the oxbow-shaped precloacal shield. The shield consists of two very wide and long median plus two pairs of narrower and shorter flanking segments. The narrow postcloacal edge is formed of 8 to 12 segments. The trunk is generally rounded anteriorly and then becomes slightly wider than high near the midbody and continues thus past the cloacal region. Posterior to the autotomy site, the caudal tip is vertically oval in cross section. The lateral sulci start at the level of the 40th body annulus, are filled with small triangular segments, and at midbody are approximately as wide as half of one of the flanking segments. Anteriorly (for the first 50 or so annuli), the middorsal sulcus is indicated only by alignment of intersegmental sutures. At midbody, it is almost as wide as the lateral ones and it continues as a depressed groove onto the base of the tail. The ventral sulcus also is only indicated by alignment of sutures.

The  <span style="color: red;">nasal</span>  is  <span style="color: green;">fused with both  <span style="color: red;">preocular supralabials</span> </span>  The  <span style="color: red;">oculars</span>  are  <span style="color: green;">large, more or less quadrangular</span>  with the corner overlaying the eye representing the ventralmost position. The more posterior portion of the  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  is covered by the  <span style="color: green;">enormous</span>  <span style="color: red;">frontal-parietal</span>  that is followed posteriorly by the small occipital, though the arrangement of sutures is irregular. The second supralabials are very large and extend to the  <span style="color: red;">dorsal surface of the  <span style="color: red;">head</span> </span>  where they are in broad contact with the anterior portion of the  <span style="color: red;">frontal-parietal</span>  shield. Posterior to it lie two postsupralabials with a rather small dorsal segment lying dorsal to the posterior one. The remaining portion of the side of the  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  is occupied by an  <span style="color: green;">enormous</span>  temporal. The fused  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  shields occupy the place of the dorsal half of the first two  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  The snout is only slightly prognathous and in ventral view the  <span style="color: red;">rostral</span>  and supralabials are only visible as a narrow crescent. The lower jaw is not markedly inserted in the bulging snout, which is almost twice as  <span style="color: green;">wide</span>  as high, higher at the preocular region than at the level of the eye. The  <span style="color: red;">mental</span>  is very  <span style="color: green;">wide</span>  anteriorly and slightly narrower posteriorly. It is clearly larger than the infralabials. The anterior suture of the second infralabial extends at an angle from the junction of the  <span style="color: red;">malars</span>  to the lip. The sutures defining the posterior edges of the  <span style="color: red;">mental</span>  and of the flanking first infralabials crosses the  <span style="color: red;">chin</span>  at the anterior level of the  <span style="color: red;">second infralabials</span> | however, the posterior portion of the  <span style="color: red;">mental</span>  terminates somewhat anterior to the posterior edges of the first infralabials. This space iS filled by a single  <span style="color: green;">wide</span>  shield that does extend beyond the edge of the first infralabials, so that it is partly postmental and partly postgenial. It is flanked by two small segments that lie median to the  <span style="color: green;">enlarged</span>  <span style="color: red;">malars</span>  and posterior to the first infralabials. Back of these three median segments lies a second postgenial row of four small segments, the back edge of which aligns with the posterior edge of the  <span style="color: red;">second infralabials</span>  The segments of the gular region are slightly reduced in size. The ninth annulus shows the first indication of fusion of the medial segments. The specimen has  <span style="color: green;">278</span>  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  from the first segment posterior to the angulus oris up to and including the pore-bearing precloacal rows. The dorsolateral portions of the third through sixth anterior annuli are folded. At midbody an annulus contains 14 always longer than  <span style="color: green;">wide</span>  dorsal segments and 7 to 8 ventral ones, of which the median ones are azygous and always more than four times as  <span style="color: green;">wide</span>  as long. The cloacal region corresponds to four lateral annuli. The tail bears  <span style="color: green;">23</span>  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  to the oval rounded tip which is more than twice the length of the next anterior annulus. Only faint segmental impressions mark its anterior edge. The seventh postcloacal annulus represents the slightly narrowed and more intensely pigmented  <span style="color: red;">autotomy site</span>  All subcaudal segments are paired. There are nine strongly indicated precloacal pores, each inserted into the middle of the posterior edge of one of the nine narrowed median segments of the precloacal annulus. This set corresponds to the width of the azygous ventral segments that reach laterally to the edge of the large and rectangular precloacal shield, which is covered by two very large segments. The postcloacal edge is formed of ten irregular segments. The trunk is generally slightly wider than high| however, it becomes rounder posteriorly and then higher than  <span style="color: green;">wide</span>  just posterior to the cloacal region. The caudal tip forms a distinct vertical oval in section. The lateral sulci start between the seventh and tenth  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  and at midbody are filled with very tiny triangular segments approximately as  <span style="color: green;">wide</span>  as one of the flanking segments. For the first 50 or so annuli, the dorsal sulcus is indicated only by alignment of intersegmental sutures| at midbody, it is almost as  <span style="color: green;">wide</span>  as the lateral ones and continues as a depressed groove onto the tail. There is no ventral sulcus. (Gans 1987: 65)<br>

Cynisca williamsi	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	DIAGNOSIS: A short, slender, pointed-headed amphisbaenian. A large rostral in wide contact with the prefrontals and consequently widely exposed in dorsal view. Two preocular supralabials, nasal, preocular, prefrontal, and ocular discrete. A median azygous shield. Very large and distinct frontals, parietals, and occipitals. Very large postocular supralabial, kept from contact with frontal by large postocular which also extends over anterior portion of postsupralabial, the more posterior portion covered by a small rectangular  <span style="color: red;">temporal</span>  Snout generally pointed. <span style="color: green;">3</span>  supralabials and 2 infralabials. First infralabials enormous, much wider and substantially longer than mental plus discrete postmental. Two  <span style="color: red;">rows of postgenials</span> (4, 5)| the latter between the short malars. 218  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span> | 14  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  Midbody segments, 16 dorsal, 12-13 ventral. Median ventral segments enlarged, paired. 6 round precloacal pores. A short  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  lacking autotomy, and with the distal surface terminating in an oblique, posteriorly facing shield fringed with a ring of projecting rounded cones. Internally, the shield is underlain by a calcified plate that seems associated with the terminal caudal vertebrae.DESCRIPTION (Pattern XVII): The meristic characters are stated in table 4. Figures 34 and 35 show views of the  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  figure 36 details of segmentation at midbody, figure 37 views of the cloacal region and  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  and details of its distal tip. Figure 38 illustrates an x-ray of the entire animal. This is a relatively small species (assuming that the male is sexually mature). Dimensions are 161 + 10.5 mm snout-vent plus  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  length and 4.5 mm midbody diameter. The trunk of the holotype is a uniform dark bluish-brown dorsally and lighter on the ventral surface| the countershading proceeding by general fading within one or two segments just ventral to the lateral sulci and the midventral segments. Pigmentation is very light, although the pigment of the midventral segments definitely drops out in a checkerboard pattern. The precloacal shield is clear. The ventral surface of the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  is pigmented and this pigmentation is particularly obvious toward the distal tip. The  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  is relatively pale and the pigment of the nuchal segments is concentrated in the center of the segments. All or part of the chin tends to be unpigmented as is the first supralabial. The collagen fibers of the extracolumellar attachment appear as a light area deep to the large first infralabial. The anterior  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  shields show no obvious fusions and the  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  segments appear symmetrical. The rostral is visible as a large pentagonal area in dorsal view. On each side it is in broad lateral contact with a very large nasal and posterodorsally it inserts between the anterior aspects of the large prefrontals. A relatively small shield-shaped pentagonal azygous segment lies along the midline with its longer anterior portion inserting between the large prefrontal shields and the shorter posterior one between the very large pentagonal frontals. The anterior edge of each frontal extends posterolaterally from the sides of the azygous to point contact with the dorsal tips of the oculars. The frontals then narrow gradually in long contact with the postocular to contact with the parietals after which they form a blunt angle to the midline. The parietals widen posterior to the frontals and then narrow slightly in contact with a small rectangular  <span style="color: red;">temporal</span>  They are followed posteriorly by a short pair of wide occipitals that derive from the median segments of the second body annulus, or of an intercalated dorsal half-annulus (lying between  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  one and two). There are two preocular supralabials| the second is larger and kept from contact with the prefrontal by the rectangular preocular that is in rectangular contact with the nasal. The polygonal ocular is diagonally placed with the large eye visible in its center. The third supralabial is enormous and extends dorsally along the posteroventral side of the ocular to contact the ventral edge of the large postocular. A large and tall first postsupralabial extends ventral to the posterior aspect of the postocular and then contacts the small rectangular  <span style="color: red;">temporal</span>  An intercalated dorsal halfannulus is indicated only by the  <span style="color: red;">temporal</span>  and the posterior portion of the parietal| it lies anterior to the first dorsal half-annulus corresponding to body annulus one. The  <span style="color: red;">temporal</span>  region is thus covered almost entirely by the posterior extension of the  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  shields and the zone of enlargement corresponds to the dorsal portions of the first body annulus. The snout is very markedly prognathous and the rostral is widely visible in ventral view. The mental is narrower posteriorly than anteriorly| it is followed by an elongate postmental and both are flanked by the enormous first infralabials. The anterior sutures of the small second infralabials extend anteriorly from the narrow malar junction to the lip. The first postgenial row comprises four segments, the median much the longest and largest, the lateral ones triangular. The second postgenial row comprises five subequal segments that are flanked by the relatively small wedge-shaped malars, the anterior tips of which just flank the first row. The ventral segments of the first six to seven  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  are reduced in size| by the 10th annulus the medial ones are squarish and by the 20th they are twice as wide as long. There are 218  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  from the first segment posterior to the angulus oris up to and including the pore-bearing precloacal row. The dorsal portion of the second to eighth anteriormost annuli is only slightly narrowed and there are no intercalated or spiral annuli within the  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span> | however, there is some annular irregularity in the precloacal region. At midbody an annulus contains 16 dorsal segments, the medial ones more than twice as long as wide, whereas the medial segments of the 12 to 13 ventral ones are approximately two times as wide as long. The cloacal region corresponds to three lateral annuli. The  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  bears 14  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  After the seventh the next three become narrowed and also of reduced diameter. The last annulus is the longest. The posterior aspect of the 14th annulus marks a sharp flat termination, as if the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  had here been cut with a slightly dorsad-facing inclination. The middorsal segments of the 12th, the dorsal segments of the 13th, and all segments of the 14th caudal annulus bear posteriorly projecting cones. A partial semicircle of cones lies within the (14th) ring on each side, whereas the center of the terminal shield is merely rugose. (See below for the underlying osseous structures.) There are six large round precloacal pores (in a continuous row) on the posterior edge of the small precloacal segments lying anterior to the precloacal shield| projecting cores are inserted into the center of each segment. The pore-bearing row corresponds to the width of the six midventral segments and to that of the segments of the eight covering the crescentic precloacal shield. The postcloacal edge is formed of 11 segments. The snout is more pointed in lateral than in dorsal view. At the level of the nostrils it is half as wide as at the level of the postsupralabials. The  <span style="color: red;">temporal</span>  region is slightly wider than the trunk at the level of the third through eighth annuli and the back of the  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  is slightly constricted. The trunk is rounded anteriorly and variably compressed dorsoventrally thereafter until the base of the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  where the cross section changes to a vertical oval. The lateral sulci start near the 30th body annulus and extend just beyond the level of the cloaca. Anteriorly, they are indicated only by alignment of sutures| at midbody each contains multiple, regular intercalated segments. The middorsal sulcus begins near the 10th annulus, but only becomes significantly widened near the 60th. It does not include any small triangular segments and it is not obvious by the level of the cloaca. Thereafter, it continues as a deep groove onto the base of the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  The ventral sulcus is indicated only by an alignment of sutures. The unique holotype was not dissected. However, a series of x-rays taken at various exposures permits some statements regarding the skeleton. The skull is generally equivalent to those of the round-headed African species. There are no special modifications of the prefrontal region| indeed, the anterior blade of the latter bone provides a simple vertical blade. The quadrate lies almost horizontal and the extracolumella appears to curve along its lateral face (it is unclear whether it here passes in a groove), before extending along the mandible. The  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  joint is normal, but no special hypocentral ossification is seen. Vertebrae and ribs are as in other species of the group. Near the base of the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  one sees the shift from the two-to-one dermal/ vertebral ratio to the one-to-one ratio characteristic of tails. There is no trace of an autotomy split. Near the 13th caudal vertebra there starts an oblique heavily ossified plate that terminates the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  It is heaviest immediately deep to the caudal shield and its base then curves inward to join the modified 14th and 15th caudal vertebrae.

Dalophia angolensis	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Diagnosis: Gans 1976: 6 Description: Gans 1976: 6 Diagnosis. A slender, medium-sized (290 to 362 mm. snout-vent length) species of Dalophia that lacks pigmentation and has 302 to 324 body and 20 to 27 caudal annuli, 16 to 24 (generally 18) dorsal and 12 to 18 (generally 14) ventral a segments to a midbody annulus and four or five first plus eight to 11 (generally eight or nine) second postgenials. The head shields are broadly fused and only the lateral blind sutures remain. There are no preoculars and the nasals (in narrow contact medially) almost always extend long wings laterally to touch the oculars. There are six elongate pectoral shields, the lateral ones often asymmetrically subdivided and the two medial pairs generally extending anteriorly into one or two annular rows. Lateral sulci are clearly expressed, but the dorsal sulcus is only indicated by intersegmental alignment. The sixth or seventh caudal annulus bears the well-defined autotomy constriction. There are few supernumerary dorsal half-annuli, but the second 50 body annuli tend to show irregular dorso-ventral alignments. The intersegmental sutures of the first 100 or so body annuli form anteriorly acute angles with the mid-line. The middorsal caudal segments posterior to the autotomy constriction are at least twice as wide as those near the base of the tail| the caudal interannular sutures form an anteriorly acute angle on the middorsal surface. (Broadley et al. 1976: 446)Description. This is a medium-sized slender species of Dalophia with the available specimens ranging from 131 to 362 mm. snout-vent length (fig. 35). None of the specimens shows pigmentation. The azygous head shield is single, more or less is pointed anteriorly, oval and relatively slender. The oculars are only partially inserted into shallow notches along its sides. A short, blind suture proceeds anteromedially for one-fifth of the shield width from each notch. The preocular region is slightly concave, however the dorsal surface of the head is faintly convex particularly along the medial line. The shield shows a high dome in transverse section. The eye is clearly visible beneath the medium-sized rectangular ocular which is in contact dorsally and anteriorly with the azygous head shield, anteroventrally with the prolongation of the nasal (excluded in NMSR 2826), ventrally with the second and generally the anterior tip of the third supralabial and posteriorly with the first of the four parietals (the medial pair the longest) that connect dorsally between the third supralabials and separate the head shields from the first body annulus. The crescent-shaped nostrils are inserted into elongate nasals which send long posterior processes to contact the ocular (except in NMSR 2826) and are generally in narrow medial contact with each other, but not with the lip. There are three supralabials, the second the longest, the third the largest and tallest. The lower jaw is covered by a broadly rectangular mental with markedly flaring anterior edges and anteriorly concave suture with the postmental, the small first, second, and enormous third infralabials, and the squat, pentagonal postmental (genial). The rectangular lateral first postgenials may or may not contact the postmental. Median to them lies a pair of subtriangular segments that either contact each other medially, or contact a tiny fifth postgenial of the first row posterior to the blunt apex of the postmental. There are six to 11 smaller second postgenials in a row that extends posterior to the medial aspects of the second infralabials as well and adjoins the deep gular fold. The modified pectoral region extends to the tenth to twelfth (generally to the eleventh) body annulus. There are six elongate and subparallel pectoral shields, the median pair slightly wider posteriorly, the next lateral widest anteriorly and the irregular lateral pair the shortest. The last (or its fission products) correspond to three to five (six in NMSR 2826) dorsal half-annuli, and the more median pairs involve six. The ventromedian segments of the next more anterior annulus are enlarged, and the four segments flanking the midline represent a complex elongation of the median pair of pectoral shields. The prepectoral annulus is definitely involved in the pectoral region. The pectoral region projects slightly posteriorly in a semicircle that distorts the post-pectoral annuli. There are 302 to 324 body annuli from the posterior edge of the third infralabial up to, but not including, the precloacal shield. The second 50 body annuli tend to show up to five supernumerary dorsal half-annuli as well as irregular dorsoventral alignments. A midbody annulus has 16 to 24 (generally 18) dorsal and 12 to 18 (generally 14) ventral segments. The middorsal segments are approximately twice as long as wide and the midventral segments one and one-half to two times as wide as long. The number of dorsal segments is consistently greater than the number of ventral segments for any given specimen. There is a marked tendency for the sutures between the dorsal segments to angle into posteriorly directed chevrons along much of the back. There are two to six (generally four or five) lateral annuli, the anterior one or two of which contact the small lateral segments of the six to eight (the median pair the largest) forming the precloacal shield. There are no precloacal pores. The stout and fairly long tail appears slightly compressed laterally and downward-curved. Its distal portion is taller than wide and its height drops abruptly over the last four of 20 to 27 (generally 23 to 27) caudal annuli. The tail terminates in a projecting and unsegmented callous pad slightly longer than a preceding annulus. There is a clear autotomy constriction at the sixth or seventh caudal annulus. In dorsal view the median segments of the tail are seen to be widened posterior to the autotomy site and the interannular raphes begin to form anteriorly open Vs midway between the autotomy site and the distal tip. The lateral sulci are strongly marked and about two-thirds as wide as an adjacent segment. The dorsal sulcus is clearly indicated by a widening of the median intersegmental raphe and irregular alignment of left and right quarter-annuli, but is not otherwise developed nor are there diagonal folding lines. There is no ventral sulcus. (Broadley et al. 1976: 446)<br>

Dalophia ellenbergeri	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Diagnosis. A medium-sized ( <span style="color: red;">365 to  <span style="color: green;">420 mm</span> </span>  <span style="color: red;">snout-vent length</span>  in adults), slender species of Dalophia lacking dark pigmentation. The species has  <span style="color: red;">312 to 344 body</span>  <span style="color: red;">three to four lateral</span>  and 35 to 43 (one specimen has 30) caudal annuli, 14 to 21 (generally 16 or 18) dorsal plus 11 to 14 (generally 12) ventral segments to a midbody annulus and two to five (generally four) first and four to nine (generally seven or eight) second postgenials. The azygous head shields are broadly fused and only lateral blind sutures occur (even in juveniles). The most heavily keratinized zone does not reach the parietal edge of the shield in juveniles. There are no preoculars. The nasals are usually in medial contact and generally fail to reach the lip| their slender posterior processes usually make contact with the oculars. There are four parietal shields. The elongate pectoral region has six slender shields, the medial ones slightly wider posteriorly and the lateral ones irregular. The four midventral segments of the precloacal annulus are enlarged and more or less wedged between the medial and adjoining pairs of pectorals. Lateral sulci are clearly expressed, but the middorsal sulcus is shown by aligned intersegmental sutures or a zigzag pattern caused by non-alignment of dorsal quarter-annuli. Additions or subtractions of dorsal half-annuli are few, but occur primarily in the second and third 50 body annuli. The species has but traces of herringbone pattern of the dorsal interannular sutures of the trunk. There is a well-marked caudal autotomy site of the sixth to eighth (generally seventh or eighth) caudal annulus. The middorsal segments of the tail may be partially or completely fused across the midline. The interannular sutures here form an anteriorly acute set of angles with the median (their points may be rounded). Each leg of the chevron is as wide as three or four more anterior segments. (Broadley et al. 1976: 451)Description. This is a medium-sized but slender species of Dalophia with the available specimens ranging from 115 to  <span style="color: green;">420 mm</span>  <span style="color: red;">snout-vent length</span> (fig. 35). All specimens are unpigmented. The azygous large head shields are always fused to form an oval shield, pointed anteriorly, with lateral blind sutures which are retained throughout life. The  <span style="color: red;">dorsal surface of the head</span>  is  <span style="color: green;">convex</span>  in profile. The  <span style="color: red;">eye</span>  is  <span style="color: green;">clearly visible</span>  as a dark spot beneath the squarish ocular, which is in contact with the nasal anteriorly and the parietals posteriorly. There are no preoculars or postoculars. Two pairs of parietal shields separate the azygous head shield from the first body annulus| the median pair is the widest, but the lateral pair may extend anteriorly to contact the second supralabial below the ocular. The nostrils are crescent-shaped and are inserted into elongate nasal scales which usually make contact with the oculars. They usually fail to reach the lip and are usually in point contact with, or narrowly separated from, each other above the triangular rostral. There are three supralabials, the second the longest. The lower jaw is formed by a pentagonal mental, the first, second, and enormous third infralabials, and a large heart-shaped postmental (genial), which is longitudinally divided in UM 7913. Posterior to the postmental are two to five (usually four) first postgenials followed by four to nine (usually seven or eight) smaller second postgenials. The modified pectoral region extends to the ninth through the twelfth dorsal annulus| there are six elongate pectorals, the medial ones slightly wider posteriorly. The four midventral segments of the prepectoral annulus are enlarged and the outer pair of these are wedged between first and second pairs of pectorals. The lateral pectorals are much shorter than the medial ones, which extend posteriorly in a semicircular bulge that distorts the postpectoral annulus strongly and the succeeding few to lesser extent. There are  <span style="color: red;">312 to 344 body</span>  annuli from the posterior edge of the third infralabial up to (but not including) the precloacal shields. A maximum of five supernumerary dorsal half-annuli may be present, usually in the second 50 body annuli. Other dorsal half-annuli may drop out, especially in the third 50 body annuli. A mid-body annulus has  <span style="color: red;">14 to 21 dorsal</span>  plus 11 to 14 (usually 12) ventral segments. The middorsal segments are approximately one and a-half to three times as long as wide, and the midventral segments are approximately two to four times as wide as long. The sutures between dorsal segments are often angled to form a pattern of posteriorly directed chevrons. There are three to four (rarely two asymmetrically) lateral annuli and six precloacal segments, the median pair largest. There are no precloacal pores. The elongate tail (fig. 36) appears dorsoventrally flattened in cross section and curves ventrally to an unsegmented truncated and callous terminal pad. On the dorsal surface of the tail posterior to the autotomy annulus the middorsal segments are nearly twice as wide as long| some may be partially or completely fused and are angled to form a series of posteriorly directed chevrons. There are 35 to 43 (30 in FMNH 142694) caudal annuli, with the seventh or eighth (sixth in FMNH 142685) a distinctly narrowed autotomy annulus. Six specimens had autotomized tails (which show faint irregular segmentation of the stump) and several others show partial breaks at this point. The lateral sulci are distinct and a dorsal sulcus may be indicated either by an alignment of the vertebral sutures or a zigzag pattern caused by nonalignment of dorsal quarter-annuli, so that they alternate on either side of the vertebral line| a similar situation may develop along the midventral line. There are no diagonal folding lines on the body. (Broadley et al. 1976: 451)<br>

A very  <span style="color: green;">large</span> (582 to 705 mm. snout-vent length) species of Dalophia lacking pigmentation and having 316 to 321 body annuli, 21 to 23 caudal annuli, 19 to 21 (generally 20) dorsal and 17 to 19 (generally 18) ventral segments to a midbody annulus and four first plus eight to 10 second postgenials. The  <span style="color: green;">two</span>  very  <span style="color: green;">large</span>  discrete, and azygous head shields show narrow medial fusion of their keratinous cover in one specimen (RGMC 32).

There are six pectoral shields, with the second on each side not reaching the posterior edge of the zone, and the  <span style="color: green;">two</span>  medial pairs extending anteriorly into  <span style="color: green;">two</span>  annular rows. Lateral and middorsal sulci are deeply expressed. There is a tendency to extra dorsal half-annuli in the second 50 body annuli. The species lacks caudal autotomy and shows no fusion or herringbone effect on the dorsal surface of trunk or tail.  (Broadley et al. 1976: 456)Description. This is the largest species of Dalophia with the available specimens ranging from 582 to 705 mm. snout-vent length (fig. 35). All specimens lack pigmentation. The dorsal surface of the head is divided into  <span style="color: green;">two</span>  azygous shields although the  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">small</span> </span>  RGMC 32 shows the medial half of the division fused and overlain by a thick sheet of keratin. The largest specimen, RGMC 4573, also has a slight asymmetrical zone of fusion of this line. The midline is slightly concave over the anterior and convex over the posterior shield, with the convexity much greater transversely. Both azygous shields, the preocular, as well as the posterior edge of (nasal or postnasal) and/or the posterior edge of the second supralabial may show local keratinization to different degrees. In RGMC 32, the smallest specimen seen, the heavy keratinization is most marked on the spade, the medial isthmus and the center of the posterior shield, whereas the lateral, preocular, and posteriorly peripheral regions show a much thinner coat. The preoculars are  <span style="color: green;">large</span>  and generally well defined (except in the syntype where part of their anterior raphe is fused). They are unique in the group in that they occupy the entire postero-lateral corners of the first azygous shield, rather than being inserted into its posterior edge with a strip of shield lateral to them (compare illustrations for D. welwitschi and species of Monopeltis). The preoculars are in ventral contact with postnasal and second supralabial. The eye is very faintly visible beneath the quadrangular ocular, which is in contact dorsally with the second azygous shield, anteriorly with the preocular, ventrally with the second supralabial, and posteriorly with a tiny triangular temporal. Sometimes it contacts a more dorsal and  <span style="color: green;">larger</span>  segment, that may be defined either as discrete postocular plus the first parietal, or as the first and second parietals of the row of eight that dorsally connect the  <span style="color: green;">third</span>  supralabials and separate the head shields from the first body annulus. The crescent-shaped nostrils are inserted in the relatively  <span style="color: green;">long</span>  nasals that generally contact the preoculars, although their posterior tips may form a separate segment. The nasals are in broad medial contact with each other, but well separated from the lips. There are  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">three</span> </span>  supralabials, the second the longest, the  <span style="color: green;">third</span>  the tallest. The lower jaw is covered by a wide mental with flaring lateral edges that show an anteriorly rounded projection and is in more or less straight contact with the postmental, by the  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">small</span> </span>  first, second, and enormous  <span style="color: green;">third</span>  infralabials, as well as by the squat, septangular postmental (genial). The elongate rectangular lateral segments of the first row of postgenials rarely make even point contact with the postmental. Medially they are joined by the triangular second pair of the row which are in point contact with each other posterior to the blunt postmental apex. There are eight to 10 segments to the second row of postgenials which lie anterior to the first deep gular fold. The modified pectoral region extends to the eighth through tenth body annuli. There are six elongate subparallel pectoral shields, the median the longest and posteriorly the widest, the next lateral the widest anteriorly and the lateralmost parallel-sided (some of the more lateral segments may also be asymmetrically fused). This smooth zone corresponds to five or six dorsal half-annuli. The medial segments of an anterior annulus are variably enlarged and also incorporated into the pectoral zone. There are 316 to 321 body annuli from the posterior edge of the  <span style="color: green;">third</span>  infralabial up to (but not including) the precloacal shields. There is a tendency to a few supernumerary half-annuli in the second 50 body annuli. A midbody annulus has 19 to 24 (generally 20) dorsal plus 16 to 19 (generally 18) ventral segments. The middorsal segments are approximately one and one-half to  <span style="color: green;">two</span>  times as  <span style="color: green;">long</span>  as wide and the midventral segments slightly wider than  <span style="color: green;">long</span>  The number of dorsal segments is slightly greater than the number of ventral segments in any specimen. There are generally four lateral annuli, the first one or  <span style="color: green;">two</span>  in contact with the  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">small</span> </span>  lateral segments of the six (the medial pair the largest) forming the precloacal shield. There are no precloacal pores. The tail is round in section, stout, and shows a slight ventral curve near its distal tip. The vertical dimension increases near its base and decreases again over the terminal four of the 21 to 23 caudal annuli. There is no autotomy and the unsegmented caudal cap is about one annulus thick and presents a smooth, oval callous surface that may extend slightly onto the dorsal surface as well. The medial row of dorsal segments is significantly widened posterior to the caudal base, but the interannular sutures cross the tail at right angles to its  <span style="color: green;">long</span>  axis. The lateral sulci are well marked and approximately as wide as an adjacent segment. The middorsal sulcus is clearly marked but somewhat narrower. There are no diagonal folding lines and the ventral sulcus is only is indicated by alignment of intersegmental raphes. (Broadley et al. 1976: 456)<br>

The  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">four</span> </span>  <span style="color: red;">midventral segments</span>  of the prepectoral annulus are more or less  <span style="color: red;">wedged</span>  <span style="color: green;">between the medial and adjoining pairs of pectorals</span>  <span style="color: red;">lateral</span>  sulci are  <span style="color: green;">clearly expressed</span>  as is the  <span style="color: red;">middorsal one</span>  <span style="color: green;">after the first third of the trunk</span>  There are  <span style="color: green;">generally a few</span>  <span style="color: red;">supernumerary dorsal half-annuli</span>  mainly in the second 50  <span style="color: red;">body</span>  annuli. The dorsal interannular sutures of the  <span style="color: red;">postnuchal region</span>  <span style="color: green;">tend to form a herringbone pattern</span>  the angle of which is affected by the degree to which the head is raised. There is no autotomy annulus. The middorsal segments of the tail are partially or completely fused across the midline. The interannular sutures here form an anteriorly acute set of angles with the median (their points may be rounded). Each leg of the chevron is as wide as three or  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">four</span> </span>  more anterior segments. (Broadley et al. 1976: 459)Description. This is a medium to large-sized species with the available specimens ranging from 155 to 520 mm. in snout-vent length (fig. 35). The head and first 30  <span style="color: red;">body</span>  annuli are unpigmented but the rest of the dorsum is lightly speckled with gray, the pigmentation being concentrated toward the edges of annuli and extending ventral to the  <span style="color: red;">lateral</span>  sulci| the pigmentation on the tail may extend right across the ventral segments. The azygous large head shields are always fused to form an oval shield, more or less pointed anteriorly and notched laterally to accommodate the oculars, from which  <span style="color: red;">blind  <span style="color: red;">lateral</span>  sutures</span>  extend anteriorly. The  <span style="color: red;">dorsal surface</span>  of the head is concave anteriorly and convex posteriorly| it forms a sigmoid curve in profile. The eye is usually visible as a dark spot beneath the subhexagonal ocular. Two pairs of parietals separate the large head shield from the first  <span style="color: red;">body</span>  annulus| the medial pair is the widest. An elongate triangular postocular is usually  <span style="color: red;">wedged</span>  between the outer parietal and the third supralabial. The nostrils are crescent-shaped and are inserted into elongate nasal scales that make contact with the oculars (or asymmetrically split off postnasals)| they are usually in good contact with one another dorsal to the triangular rostral and usually just  <span style="color: green;">fail to reach the lip</span>  There are three supralabials, the second the longest. The lower jaw is formed by a squarish mental, the first, second, and enormous third infralabials and a large shield-shaped postmental (genial). Posterior to the postmental are  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">three to six</span> </span> (usually  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">four</span> </span>  or five) first and eight to 13 elongate second  <span style="color: red;">postgenials</span>  The postmental may contact the second row of  <span style="color: red;">postgenials</span>  on the midventral line, or the large median pair of first  <span style="color: red;">postgenials</span>  may be separated by small azygous scale. The modified  <span style="color: red;">pectoral region</span>  extends to the ninth through the twelfth  <span style="color: red;">body</span>  annulus| there are  <span style="color: green;">six elongate shields</span>  the medial pair widened posteriorly, the  <span style="color: red;">lateral</span>  pair often shorter than the inner ones and corresponding to only  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">four</span> </span>  or five, instead of six, dorsal half-annuli. The  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">four</span> </span>  <span style="color: red;">midventral segments</span>  of the prepectoral annulus are enlarged and the outer pair are diamond-shaped and  <span style="color: red;">wedged</span>  between the two inner pairs of pectorals. The whole  <span style="color: red;">pectoral region</span>  projects posteriorly in a semicircle that strongly distorts the first postpectoral annulus and the succeeding few to a lesser extent. There are  <span style="color: green;">307 to 338</span>  <span style="color: red;">body</span>  annuli from the posterior edge of the third infralabial up to (but not including) the precloacal shields. <span style="color: red;">supernumerary dorsal half-annuli</span>  are usually few (maximum 13 in UM 23057) and mostly fall in the second 50  <span style="color: red;">body</span>  annuli. A few dorsal half-annuli drop out here and there. A  <span style="color: red;">midbody annulus</span>  has 18 to 24 dorsal plus 12 to 16 ventral segments. The middorsal segments are approximately two to three times as long as wide and the  <span style="color: red;">midventral segments</span>  one and a-half to three times as wide as long. Intersegmental raphes are more or less parallel to the longitudinal  <span style="color: red;">body</span>  axis.

There are no precloacal pores. The elongate tail (fig. 36) appears subcylindrical or slightly flattened above and below in cross section and terminates in an unsegmented callous pad. The middorsal segments (except for few proximal ones) are fused and form posteriorly directed chevrons| there may also be a few fused  <span style="color: red;">midventral segments</span>  There are  <span style="color: green;">33 to 42</span>  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  and no trace of autotomy, despite extensive damage to the tails of some specimens by bulldozers. The  <span style="color: red;">lateral</span>  and middorsal sulci are distinct. There are no diagonal folding lines on the  <span style="color: red;">body</span>  (Broadley et al. 1976: 459)<br>

Dalophia pistillum	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Diagnosis. A medium to large (320 to 560 mm. snout-vent length in adults) species of Dalophia, with the dorsal surface (generally to just ventral of the  <span style="color: red;">lateral sulci</span>  sometimes irregularly more ventral, particularly beneath the tail) with  <span style="color: green;">gray</span>  speckling that may concentrate along the annular and segmental edges. The species has  <span style="color: green;">280 to 352</span>  body, <span style="color: green;">two to five</span>  lateral and  <span style="color: green;">19 to 33</span>  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  <span style="color: green;">17 to 30</span> (generally 20, 22, or 24) dorsal plus  <span style="color: green;">12 to 17</span> (generally 14) <span style="color: red;">ventral segments</span>  to a  <span style="color: red;">midbody annulus</span>  and two to six (usually  <span style="color: green;">four</span> ) first and seven to 14 (generally nine to 10) second postgenials. The  <span style="color: red;">azygous</span>  <span style="color: red;">head shields</span>  are broadly  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">fused</span> </span>  and only  <span style="color: red;">blind lateral sutures</span>  remain (absent in one specimen). The most heavily keratinized zone does not reach the parietal edge of the shield and is also scalloped medially over the blind sutures. There are no preoculars. The nasals are usually in median contact and usually just fail to reach the lip, their slender posterior processes (or asymmetrically split off postnasals) usually contact the oculars. There are  <span style="color: green;">four</span> (rarely six) parietal shields. The  <span style="color: red;">pectoral region</span>  has  <span style="color: green;">six elongate shields</span>  often somewhat irregularly arranged and with the medial pair much the widest posteriorly. The  <span style="color: green;">four</span>  <span style="color: red;">midventral segments</span>  of the  <span style="color: red;">precloacal annulus</span>  are enlarged and more or less wedged between the medial and adjoining pairs of pectorals. Lateral and  <span style="color: red;">middorsal sulci</span>  are clearly expressed, particularly in larger specimens. Additions or subtractions of  <span style="color: red;">dorsal half-annuli</span>  are few, but occur mainly in the second 50  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  The species lacks a herringbone pattern of dorsal  <span style="color: red;">interannular sutures</span>  on the trunk as well as caudal autotomy. The middorsal segments of the tail may be partially or completely  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">fused</span> </span>  across the midline. The  <span style="color: red;">interannular sutures</span>  here form an  <span style="color: green;">anteriorly acute</span>  set of angles with the median (their points are often rounded). Each leg of the  <span style="color: red;">chevron</span>  is as  <span style="color: green;">wide</span>  as three or  <span style="color: green;">four</span>  more anterior segments. [See section on geographic variation.] (Broadley et al. 1976: 463)Description. This is a medium to large-sized species, with the available specimens ranging from 130 to 560 mm. snout-vent length (fig. 35). The anterior quarter of the body is usually unpigmented, but thereafter there is light  <span style="color: green;">gray</span>  speckling on the dorsum that may concentrate along the annular sutures| sometimes this speckling extends irregularly ventral to the  <span style="color: red;">lateral sulci</span>  whereas on the tail the  <span style="color: red;">pigmentation</span>  may extend right across the  <span style="color: red;">ventral segments</span>  In UM 22703 the posterior three-quarters of the dorsum is heavily pigmented with  <span style="color: green;">gray</span>  and there are  <span style="color: green;">gray</span>  blotches on the dorsal surface of the tail including the caudal cap. The  <span style="color: red;">azygous</span>  large  <span style="color: red;">head shields</span>  are always  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">fused</span> </span>  to form an oval shield, more or less pointed anteriorly, with lateral blind sutures that are  <span style="color: green;">retained</span>  throughout life (lost in UM 22703). The dorsal surface of the head is concave anteriorly and convex posteriorly, forming a sigmoid curve in profile. The eye is usually visible as a dark spot beneath the subhexagonal ocular. Two (rarely three) pairs of parietals separate the head shield from the first body annulus| the medial pair is the widest. An elongate triangular postocular is usually wedged between the outer parietal and the third supralabial. The nostrils are crescent-shaped and are inserted into elongate nasal scales that are usually in contact with the oculars (or asymmetrically split off postnasals), except in some eastern specimens in which they are well separated. The nasals are usually in good contact with each other above the triangular rostral| they usually just fail to reach the lip. There are three supralabials, the second the longest. The lower jaw is formed by a squarish mental, the first, second, and enormous third infralabials and a large shield-shaped postmental (genial). Posterior to the postmental are two to six (usually  <span style="color: green;">four</span> ) first and seven to 14 elongate second row postgenials. The medial first row postgenials may be separated by the distal wedge of the postmental. The modified  <span style="color: red;">pectoral region</span>  extends to the ninth to twelfth body annulus. There are  <span style="color: green;">six elongate shields</span> | the median pair is much widened posteriorly, the lateral pair often shorter than the medial ones and corresponds to only  <span style="color: green;">two to five</span>  instead of six, <span style="color: red;">dorsal half-annuli</span>  The  <span style="color: green;">four</span>  <span style="color: red;">midventral segments</span>  of the prepectoral annulus are enlarged and the outer pair of these are wedged between the first and second pairs of pectorals. The entire  <span style="color: red;">pectoral region</span>  projects posteriorly in a semicircle which distorts the postpectoral annulus strongly and the succeeding few to a lesser extent. There are  <span style="color: green;">280 to 352</span>  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  from the posterior edge of the third infralabial up to (but not including) the precloacal shields. A few  <span style="color: red;">dorsal half-annuli</span>  may be  <span style="color: green;">added or subtracted</span>  mainly in the second 50  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  A  <span style="color: red;">midbody annulus</span>  has  <span style="color: green;">17 to 30</span>  dorsal plus  <span style="color: green;">12 to 17</span>  <span style="color: red;">ventral segments</span>  The middorsal segments are approximately two to three times as long as  <span style="color: green;">wide</span>  and the  <span style="color: red;">midventral segments</span>  one and a-half to three times as  <span style="color: green;">wide</span>  as long. Only anteriorly is there a slight tendency for sutures between  <span style="color: red;">dorsal segments</span>  to be angled to form posteriorly directed chevrons. There are  <span style="color: green;">two to five</span>  <span style="color: red;">lateral annuli</span>  and  <span style="color: green;">four</span>  to SIX precloacal segments, the median pair the largest. There are no precloacal pores. The moderate tail (fig. 36) appears slightly flattened dorsally and ventrally and terminates in an unsegmented callous pad. The middorsal segments are usually partially or completely  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">fused</span> </span>  to form posteriorly directed chevrons (not  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">fused</span> </span>  or  <span style="color: red;">chevron</span>  shaped in UM 22703). There are  <span style="color: green;">19 to 33</span>  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  and no autotomy. The lateral and  <span style="color: red;">middorsal sulci</span>  are  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">distinct</span> </span>  There are no diagonal folding lines on the body.

Dalophia welwitschii	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Diagnosis (genus). Very similar to Monopeltis, but nasal shields almost always separated by rostral segment, no precloacal pores, generally only a single cephalic shield, always a modified pectoral region, and tip of the tail always squarely truncate and produced into a flattened callous pad. Table 2 presents meristic differences for all but the northernmost populations. (Broadley et al. 1976, Modified after Vanzolini 1951)Diagnosis. A  <span style="color: red;">medium-sized</span> ( <span style="color: green;">268 to 293 mm</span>  snout-vent length) species of Dalophia lacking pigmentation and having 264 to 270 body and 19 caudal annuli, 17 to 20 dorsal, and 14 to 17 ventral segments to a midbody annulus and four first plus eight or nine second postgenials. The  <span style="color: red;">head shields</span>  are  <span style="color: green;">broadly fused</span>  and only  <span style="color: red;">lateral blind sutures</span>  <span style="color: green;">remain</span>  The types lack preoculars, but USNM 26387 retains traces thereof, and the  <span style="color: red;">nasals</span> (which are  <span style="color: green;">not in contact medially</span> ) are  <span style="color: green;">excluded</span>  from contact with the  <span style="color: red;">ocular regions</span>  by the  <span style="color: red;">third supralabial</span>  which  <span style="color: green;">broadly touches</span>  the head shield. The two lateral pairs of the six  <span style="color: red;">pectoral shields</span>  are  <span style="color: green;">irregularly divided</span>  and the  <span style="color: red;">anterior zone</span>  of the medial pairs  <span style="color: green;">extends into two annular rows</span>  <span style="color: red;">lateral sulci</span>  are  <span style="color: green;">deeply incised</span>  and the  <span style="color: red;">middorsal sulcus</span>  is  <span style="color: green;">mainly shown</span>  as a zigzag alignment of  <span style="color: red;">intersegmental sutures</span>  the dorsal surface of the trunk being  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">crisscrossed</span> </span>  by  <span style="color: red;">deep diagonal folds</span>  The  <span style="color: red;">fifth or sixth caudal annulus</span>  <span style="color: green;">bears the autotomy constriction</span>  There are neither fusions nor herring-bone patterns along the segments of the dorsal surface of the tail. (Broadley et al. 1976: 442)Description. This is small to  <span style="color: red;">medium-sized</span>  species of Dalophia with the available specimens ranging from  <span style="color: green;">268 to 293 mm</span>  snout-vent length (fig. 35). The specimens are faded or the species lacks pigmentation. The azygous head shield is single (more or less pointed anteriorly), and oval| blind, anteriorly directed sutures enter from the anteromedial tip of the ocular and extend for sixth (to a third) of the width of the shield. (One specimen shows a preocular, the keratinization of the anterior edge of which is partially fused.) The eye is faintly visible as a dark spot deep beneath the tiny subpentagonal ocular which is in contact dorsally with the posterior portion of the azygous shield, anteriorly with the anterior portion thereof (or the preocular), ventrally with the third infralabial, and posteriorly with the first of four parietals (the medial pair the longest) that connect the third supralabials and separate the  <span style="color: red;">head shields</span>  from the first body annulus. The crescent-shaped nostrils insert into elongate  <span style="color: red;">nasals</span>  that send long posterior processes that do not reach the oculars (or preoculars), the lip, or each other. There are three supralabials, the first the smallest, the second by far the longest, and the third the tallest. The lower jaw iS covered by a wide, rectangular mental with flaring anterior sides and complexly curved posterior contact with the postmental, the first, second, and enormous third infralabials, and the large, heart-shaped post-mental (genial). The two rectangular lateral segments of the first postgenial row may or may not contact the postmental| the triangular medial first postgenials contact each other behind the posterior apex of the postmental. There are eight to nine second postgenials anterior to the deep gular folds. The modified pectoral region extends to the eighth through the tenth body annulus. There are six elongate and subparallel  <span style="color: red;">pectoral shields</span>  the medial pair widest posteriorly (but almost perfectly parallel), and the lateral pairs showing irregular fusions. The enlarged shields correspond to five or six dorsal half-annuli. The next anterior annulus is widened medially and involved in the pectoral shield and produces two large median segments that interdigitate between the first and second shields on each side. The pectoral region projects posteriorly in a semicircle that distorts the following body annuli. There are 264 to 270 body annuli from the posterior edge of the third infralabial up to (but not including) the precloacal shields. One or two supernumerary dorsal half-annuli occur in the first 50 body annuli, six or seven in the second 50, and none thereafter. A midbody annulus has 17 to 20 dorsal plus 14 to 17 ventral segments. The middorsal segments are approximately two to two and one-half times as long as wide and the midventral segments one and one-half times as wide as long. There is faint tendency for the sutures between the dorsal segments to angle into posteriorly directed chevrons. There are three to five lateral annuli, two of which contact the outer of the six precloacal shields, of which the median pair is widest (and the  <span style="color: red;">intersegmental sutures</span>  angle posteromedially, rather than paralleling the long axis). There are no precloacal pores. The moderate tail appears slightly compressed laterally and down-curved. Its distal portion is taller than wide and its height drops abruptly over the last four of the 19 caudal annuli. The tail terminates in a projecting and unsegmented, vertically oval callous pad with the projection slightly longer than a preceding annulus. In dorsal view the interannular sutures cross the tail transversely without herringbone effect. The  <span style="color: red;">fifth or sixth caudal annulus</span>  <span style="color: green;">bears the autotomy constriction</span>  The  <span style="color: red;">lateral sulci</span>  are deep and distinct and as wide as an adjacent segment. There is some trace of a  <span style="color: red;">middorsal sulcus</span>  as a zigzag alignment of  <span style="color: red;">intersegmental sutures</span>  and irregularities| the dorsal surface of the trunk is  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">crisscrossed</span> </span>  by an unusual density of deep, diagonal folding lines. The ventral sulcus is indicated only by alignment of intersegmental raphes. (Broadley et al. 1976: 442)<br>

Leposternon microcephalum	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Diagnosis (genus): relatively large and robust body, head dorsoventrally compressed, nostrils opening on the ventral surface of snout, suture connecting each nostril to the edge of mouth, nasal shield absent, rostronasal shield followed by a sequence of one to five enlarged shields along the dorsal surface of head, gular portion without segmental cover, more than two dermal annuli per vertebrae, tail very short with rounded tip, autotomic site absent on tail, and none to four preocloacal pores (Ribeiro et al., 2008, Ribeiro et al. 2011).IDENTIFICATION: Leposternon microcephalum can be identified by the following characteristics [based on Gans' (1971) key to Leposternon species]: three or more rows of enlarged shields atop the head, suture pattern often complex| pectoral region complex or not| a very large first supralabial followed by a smaller second supralabial| azygous often fused in various ways with adjacent head shields| a medial pair of elongate pectoral shields, with other modified, possibly enlarged shields radiating out from these anteriorly| always significantly (5-25) more dorsal than ventral postpectoral annuli with the increase greater in the second-fifth, third-fifth, and fourth-fifth of the trunk| (177-242 postpectoral annuli) (Gans 1971). In addition, L. microcephalum can be identified by the absence of precloacal pores, and the presence the supraocular shields, azygous shield distinct of the frontal, 2/2 supralabials, 2/2 infralabials, parietals distinct, prefrontals representing less than 30% (was incorrectly stated as being more than 28% in the key to the species) of the head length [14.5–29.5% (n = 71| Mean = 22.1| SD ± 2.5)], and azygous representing less than 59% of head width [29.6–58.8 % (n = 105| Mean = 44.0| SD ± 5.7) (Ribeiro et al, 2015).<br>

Leposternon octostegum	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	DIAGNOSIS: A species of Leposternon with an enlarged, polygonal azygous shield atop the head, which, however, does not exclude the discrete prefrontals, oculars and first temporals shields of the dorsal cephalic area posterior to the rostronasal| one large supralabial and one large infralabial shield on each side of mouth| a large mental shield (postmental shield absent, probably fused with the mental shield)| <span style="color: green;">353–382</span>  <span style="color: red;">ventral, postpectoral halfannuli</span> (Barros-Filho et al. 2019).DEFINITION: A slender, medium-sized (388mm maximum adult total length) form of Leposternon, with an enlarged, polygonal azygous shield atop the head| in dorsal view, the rostronasal, the prefrontals, the oculars, the first temporals and a small pair of occipitals are also clearly discernible| one large supralabial and one large infralabial| mental and postmental shields, probably fused| three pairs of enlarged shields along the midline, with left and right asymmetries: the anterior pair forms a rough stretched pentagon pointing backwards, the second pair has irregular polygons tending to a medial suture in an “X” disposition and the posterior pair showing polygonal transversely elongated shields, larger caudad than rostrad| <span style="color: green;">353–382</span>  ventral, 357–397 dorsal postpectoral half-annuli| <span style="color: green;">24–33</span>  dorsal half-annuli scales| <span style="color: green;">23–29</span>  ventral half-annuli scales| <span style="color: green;">12–15</span>  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span> | a short, cylindrical and round ending tail| <span style="color: green;">121–142</span>  <span style="color: red;">precloacal vertebrae</span> | absent precloacal pores and autotomy.

Leposternon polystegum	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Original description (grayii): “Head rather short, broad| the vertebral plate hexagonal, elongate, as long as broad| the frontal plate very short and broad the parietal shields oblique| the occipital much longer than broad| temporal shields larger on the side of the occipital| plates of the sternal disk symmetrical, in oblique diverging lines.” (Gray 1865)Description: “The two specimens of group four from Bahia are separated out by their very high  <span style="color: red;">postpectoral counts</span>  and distinct head pattern. Their head segmentation (figs. 9, 12) is characterized by a narrowing and elongation of the frontals, which anteriorly enclose a very small azygous, and reduction in size of the prefrontals, as well as the occurrence of a small pair of first supralabials and of a pair of small first infralabials. There is a sharp groove or bend at the junction of the rostronasal with the more posterior head shields. The rostronasal, but not the more posterior head shields, is almost always keratinized. Equivalent head patterns are also shown by group three from Pernambuco and Rio Grande do Norte, by group two from Pará (fig. 13), and by eight specimens lacking any locality data (including one specimen attributed to the mouth of the Rio Negro, Argentina). These specimens also show high  <span style="color: red;">postpectoral counts</span>  although the counts have an extensive range (R=80). The relatively high ( <span style="color: green;">122-141</span> ) counts of  <span style="color: red;">body vertebrae</span>  have a significantly lower range (R =19). All specimens of this sample have the pectoral region filled with enlarged segments (of reduced number) that are never elongate and are arranged in rows of anteriorly open chevrons (fig. 9). All specimens, furthermore, have from zero to eight more dorsal than ventral segments per annulus, and show a faint but definite precloacal pore on each side of the precloacal shield.” (Gans 1971: 406)VARIATION: “There is considerable variability in the shape and arrangement of the segments along the posterior junction of the rostronasal. The two prefrontal may fuse completely or in part with the azygous or alternately with the pair of segments immediately posterior to them. The azygous may contact the rostronasal and its size varies by a factor of four. All but one of the specimens from Rio Grande do Norte and Pernambuco have the azygous in broad contact with the rostronasal| in specimens from Pará and Bahia there may be point contact but the rostronasal is more commonly excluded by contact between the prefrontals. Although the  <span style="color: red;">postpectoral counts</span>  of these specimens are always high (R= <span style="color: green;">244-324</span>  m= 278), three seemingly non-overlapping, geographically separated groups are noted (fig. 14). Thus, the Rio Grande do Norte specimens have low (R=244-250, m=247) counts of postpectoral annuli, those from Pernambuco have intermediate (R=268-282, m=275) counts, and those from Bahia have high (R=306-324, m=315) counts. Unfortunately, <span style="color: red;">postpectoral counts</span>  are lacking for the three specimens from Pará| one specimen is damaged and the counts for the other two were recorded together with those of anterior laterals. Yet, it would appear that Pará specimens are in the high range as the available counts are very high. What is interesting is that the numbers of  <span style="color: red;">body vertebrae</span>  reflect the same pattern much more faintly. The variation is thus in the number of dermal annuli per vertebra, rather than in the vertebral number per se. Specimens with no locality span the composite range of postpectoral annuli (R =253297, m=277).Data for numbers of dorsal postpectorals and, to a lesser extent, of segments per annulus also show geographical variation. Unfaded specimens have the pigment evenly distributed over segments of the dorsal and lateral aspects and pigmentation often extends to the dorsal head segments.The present samples are apparently drawn from a single species that shows considerable geographic variation in meristic characters. It is also possible that the several areas are each inhabited by closely similar, yet replacing species, but such a hypothesis cannot be tested with the present disjunctly distributed samples.” (Gans 1971: 406)<br>

(Gans & Kraklau 1989)DESCRIPTION: Loveridgea ionidesii is a small to medium-size species. The syntypes are faded to a uniform pale brown. More recently collected specimens show an even brown  <span style="color: red;">dorsal color</span>  with the center of each segment very slightly more densely colored. Anteriorly, the pigmentation is rather dense on the parietals, less so on the temporals and sometimes the back of the frontals. The more anterior segments occasionally show a blotchy pattern. The anterior and posterior ends of the trunk are more densely pigmented than the middle of the trunk| particularly the distal cap of autotomized and healed caudal tips is very dark. Laterally on the trunk, the color fades. Pigmented segments drop out in a checkerboard pattern, about one row of segments dorsal to the lateral sulcus, although some specimens have much of the venter pigmented. The segments on the underside of the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  generally are pigmented, although more lightly than those on the dorsal surface| segments of the lateroventral (not medioventral) edges of the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  tend to be colorless, producing a checkerboard pattern. (The ventral caudal surface is occasionally unpigmented.) Some postcloacals may be densely pigmented, others not. The autotomy annulus and the adjacent annuli are densely pigmented. The rounded snout is prognathous and the  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  shields are not differentially keratinized. The rostral shield is invisible in dorsal view. Four pairs of enlarged shields, namely the nasals, prefrontals, (fused) frontals, and parietals cover the dorsal surface of the  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  The nasals are always in broad contact along the dorsal midline and, along with the rostral, form the tip of the snout. Dorsoposteriorly, each nasal abuts one of the paired prefrontals. The shorter frontals are medially fused to produce a single V-shaped shield. The subtriangular parietals form the posteriormost enlarged pair| their narrow and extended posterior tips lie at the level of the first body annulus. Posteriorly, they abut the medial pair of rectangular segments of the second body annulus (occipitals?)| the next lateral segments of this annulus are significantly enlarged. The first supralabial is elongate and dorsally makes point contact with the nasal and prefrontal| the second supralabial is taller, contacts the prefrontal, frontal (in point contact), and triangular ocular, through which the eye is visible. The third supralabial is higher than long and dorsally abuts the parietal. The posterior tip of the third supralabial may extend slightly beyond the angulus oris which corresponds to the posterior suture of the third infralabial. However, the suture between the postsupralabial and post-infralabial shields is deeper than that between other cephalic shields. The oculars are distinct, but there are no postoculars. The enormous postsupralabial dorsally abuts the parietal shields| all of these form the dorsal portion of the first body annulus. The rostral is broadly visible in ventral view. The deep lower jaw is partially inset into the ventral surface of the snout. In ventral view, the mental starts as wide as the rostral portion of the labial edge, but slims down posteriorly to contact the anterior edge of the narrower shield-shaped postmental. The mental is flanked by smaller first infralabials. The postmental is flanked by first infralabials and much larger second ones. It has only point contact with the enormous malars. The third infralabial is narrowly rectangular and the single postinfralabial is smaller. The small postgenial segments of the first row number 2 (to  <span style="color: green;">3</span> ), there are generally  <span style="color: green;">3</span> ( <span style="color: green;">3</span> -5) in the second and occasionally a third row with 4 to 5. Rarely are one or both lateral segments of the first row continuous with the second. However, the medial segment of the first row may extend to lie between the first and second rows. The "postmalar" row comprises generally 8, rarely 7 to 10 segments| they and the postinfralabials form the ventral portion of the first body annulus. The ventral portions of the second to fifth  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  are narrowed. Fewer than  <span style="color: green;">1</span>  percent of the specimens show ventral interruptons forming intercalated dorsal half-annuli in the anterior quarter of the trunk. The dorsal portion of the second through sixth  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  is very slightly longer than the lateral and ventral ones. Pectoral scales are not otherwise differentiated| the more posterior interannular sutures cross the ventral surface at close to right angles to the long axis. Specimens have 232 to 257  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  from the first segments posterior to the angulus oris up to and including the pore-bearing precloacal row. One or very rarely two intercalations or fusions, sometimes involving a spiral displacement, occur just anterior to the cloaca of most specimens. At midbody an annulus contains 12 to 16 dorsal segments, generally slightly longer than wide, and 14 to 18 ventral ones, the medial about twice as wide as long. The cloacal region corresponds to three to four lateral annuli. The  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  bears 20 to 26  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  the last being partly incorporated into a narrow and vertically oval caudal tip. The variably expressed autotomy site (at which half the observed tails were broken and at least partially healed) falls between the 8th and 11th caudal annulus. There are four generally substantial round to suboval precloacal pores (rarely pore scars, lacking cores), each inset into the posterior edge of one of the median segments of the last body annulus. (As far as could be checked the pores of sexually mature males always had a 50% larger diameter than those of females, and all pore scars occurred on females.) The elongate precloacal shield consists of two wide median plus two to six narrower flanking segments (total 4-8). The narrow postcloacal edge is formed of 10 to 16 segments.The  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  is pointed and vertically oval in the preocular region, becoming of rounded cross section thereafter. The nuchal region barely narrows. Past it the trunk increases in diameter and has a generally round, slightly oval horizontal, cross section. The trunk is generally horizontally oval| however, it becomes slightly higher than wide just anterior to the cloacal region and the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  is slightly compressed vertically. The lateral sulci start at the level of the 45th body annulus and extend down to the level of the cloaca and, at midbody, are filled with some imbricate segments in a gap as wide as the flanking segments which are in turn approximately one-half as wide as the adjacent segments. The middorsal and midventral sulci are indicated only by alignment of intersegmental sutures.

Mesobaena huebneri	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Description (genus): The prognathous snout is highly elongate, as well as pointed and laterally compressed. Enlarged shields cover it for some distance beyond the angulus oris. The nasals are large and elongate, and lie on the sides of the head so that the nostrils open lateroventrally. The prefrontals are large and in point-contact with each other. The rostral is very large and ascends the full height of the face so that its posterior tip contacts or approximates the level of the triangular frontal tip that reaches beyond the interocular line. The bluntly conical tail has a poorly marked autotomy annulus, and shows a doubled vertical keel on its distal surface. <span style="color: red;">there are four precloacal pores</span>  <span style="color: red;">arranged in two pairs</span>  (Gans 1971: 22)DIAGNOSIS: An amphisbaenian with a very elongate, highly domed head and enormous rostral which prevents the nasals and most of the prefrontals from medial contact. The frontals extend significantly beyond the level of the angulus oris. The species has a single, uninterrupted row of four precloacal pores and a poorly marked autotomy constriction. (Gans 1971: 23)DEFINITION: A small to medium-sized amphisbaenian with a very elongate, highly domed head and a laterally compressed prognathous snout that is covered by the rostral. Rostral tip and dorsal aspect of large specimens are markedly keratinized. The rostral is flanked by the nasals and the elongate and very large prefrontals on each side keeping the latter from more than point contact on the midline. The nostrils face lateroventrally. There are (ordinarily) three supralabials and three infralabials, the last in each case extending significantly beyond the angulus oris. The frontals are paired and triangular, their posterior tip reaching beyond the level of the angulus oris| the oculars are large, and there is a single even larger temporal on each side. The mental is twice as long as the postmental, and the second infralabial is the largest segment on the chin. There are three postgenial rows. Four, small, round precloacal pores lie in an interrupted row on the anterolateral corners of each segment of two pairs, that are positioned just anterior to the wings of the precloacal shields. The bluntly conical tail has a poorly marked autotomy annulus at the sixth caudal annulus and terminates in an unsegmented, produced, doubled vertical keel. There are 259 to 283 body annuli| 17 to 19 caudal annuli| and 12 to 14 dorsal and 12 to 15 ventral segments to a midbody annulus. Ventral sulci are absent but the dorsal and lateral sulci are clearly marked. The dorsal segments bear sharply defined, very dark spots that extend ventrad to the level of the lateral line, except that the head is clear and the ventral surface of the tail is also pigmented. (Gans 1971: 23)GEOGRAPHICAL VARIATION: The sample is hardly adequate to justify consideration of this topic. Yet the three localities exhibit a decreasing cline in number of body annuli going from west to east. The three specimens from Colombia furthermore show one or two segments divided off the posterior aspect of the two third labials so that variably long third supralabials and infralabials are connected by two or three discrete segments rather than four as in both specimens from Venezuela. Finally, the Venezuelan specimens have the lateral segments of the second postgenial row very elongated to extend parallel to the first row.

Monopeltis infuscata	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Diagnosis. A plesiomorphic sibling species of M. capensis, from which it is distinguished by its extensive dark dorsal pigmentation and the presence of a transverse division of the large dorsal head shield in juveniles, which persists as a pair of blind lateral clefts in nearly half of the adult specimens. There are usually four postgenials in the first row rather than two or three as in M. capensis. (Broadley 1997).Description. (paratype variations in parentheses). A medium-sized species measuring 255 + 13 mm (snout-vent length 90 to 280 mm). Pigmentation consists of a few dark patches anterior to the 50th body annulus, thereafter the entire dorsal surface is grey-brown above the  <span style="color: red;">lateral sulci</span>  becoming darker on the tail, but patchy on the caudal tip (pigmentation may be very reduced or absent on the anterior quarter of the body, pigmentation rarely extends ventral to the  <span style="color: red;">lateral sulci</span>  but may cover the mid-ventral segments of the tail). The large dorsal head shield has very short blind sutures extending diagonally forward from the oculars, fitting into notches on the edges of the shield, which in profile is feebly convex posteriorly and slightly concave anteriorly (two discrete azygous dorsal head shields in some juveniles, these gradually fuse in adults, but many retain short lateral sutures). The elongate ocular shield is slightly convex (the eye may be visible as a black spot) and is in contact anteriorly with the second supralabial and posteriorly with the parietals (there may be a small triangular subocular)| a row of four ( <span style="color: green;">4</span>  to 6) parietals separates the large head shield from the first body annulus. The nostrils are crescent-shaped and pierced in moderate nasal scales, which are separated from the oculars, the lip (sometimes in short contact), and each other. Three supralabials (very rarely 2 or  <span style="color: green;">4</span> ), the third by far the largest. The lower jaw is formed by a subrectangular mental, three infralabials, the third enormous, and large shield-shaped postmental or genial (occasionally longitudinally bisected), followed by four (2 to 5) anterior and six (5 to 10) small posterior postgenials. The modified pectoral region extends to the ninth (8th to 10th) dorsal annulus| there are five (usually six) elongate pectorals, the medial pair narrowing anteriorly and projecting slightly forward, so that the midventral segments of the prepectoral annulus curve around them (the outer pair of pectorals may be more or less broken up into the four or five constituant segments. or may be partially fused with the adjoining pectorals). There are  <span style="color: green;">203</span> (179 to 209) <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  from the posterior edge of the third infralabial up to the precloacal shields. There are  <span style="color: green;">18</span> (+ to 27) <span style="color: red;">supernumerary dorsal half-annuli</span>  corresponding to the first 50  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span> (there may be one or two additional half-annuli in the precloacal region). A  <span style="color: red;">midbody annulus</span>  has  <span style="color: green;">23-25</span> (19 to 32) dorsal and  <span style="color: green;">23-25</span> ( <span style="color: green;">18</span>  to 27) ventral segments, the middorsal segments are approximately three to four times as long as wide and the midventral segments are square (one and a half times as long as wide to one and a half times as wide as long). The number of  <span style="color: red;">dorsal segments</span>  is subequal to (or only slightly greater than) the number of ventral segments. The  <span style="color: red;">lateral sulci</span>  are  <span style="color: green;">distinct</span>  but there are no dorsal or ventral sulci. There are numerous diagonal folding lines on the dorsal surface of the body. There are four (3 to 6) <span style="color: red;">lateral annuli</span>  the first one contacting the two enlarged medial precloacal shields (the terminal segments usually bearing one (rarely 2) precloacal pore). The short tail is smoothly rounded and appears subcylindrical in cross section. There are nine (6 to 11) <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  with no autotomy. The  <span style="color: red;">caudal cap</span>  is covered with  <span style="color: green;">irregular segments</span>  (Broadley 1997).Variation in western populations. The western populations of M. infuscata do not differ significantly from the type series (Table 1), but apparently attain a larger size, the maximum being 340 + 16 mm (TMP 29815, Alheit, Northern Cape Province).

The  <span style="color: red;">azygous head shields</span>  are  <span style="color: green;">paired</span>  the  <span style="color: red;">ocular</span>  being  <span style="color: green;">wedged between them</span>  There are no preoculars. The  <span style="color: red;">nasals</span>  are  <span style="color: green;">short</span>  and do not contact the oculars, the lip, or each other. There are  <span style="color: green;">four to seven (usually six)</span> <span style="color: red;">parietal shields</span>  The  <span style="color: red;">pectoral zone</span>  is  <span style="color: green;">rectangular</span>  and the  <span style="color: red;">sutures</span>  between the six (very rarely four) shields are  <span style="color: green;">parallel</span>  They correspond to four dorsal  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  except when the lateral ones are broken up.

No autotomy occurs.Description. This is a medium-sized species of Monopeltis with the available specimens ranging from 90 to 290 mm. in snout-vent length (fig. 20). The  <span style="color: red;">dorsal surface</span>  from nuchal region to tail tip is  <span style="color: green;">heavily pigmented</span>  grayish or reddish brown, the pigmentation extends for two or three segments ventral to the lateral sulcus and a little farther along the interannular  <span style="color: red;">sutures</span>  There are often extensive areas of pigmentation on the large  <span style="color: red;">azygous head shields</span>  but the midventral surface is unpigmented. The areas of densest pigmentation tend to be the nuchal region and the  <span style="color: red;">dorsal surface</span>  of the tail. Juveniles are less strongly pigmented. The  <span style="color: red;">dorsal surface</span>  of the head is divided into two azygous shields. The dorsal region of the anterior head shield is slightly concave and that of the posterior shield is convex. The eye is usually visible as a dark spot beneath the lozenge-shaped  <span style="color: red;">ocular</span>  which usually makes contact with the second supralabial and is bordered posteriorly by a small postocular. A series of  <span style="color: green;">four to seven (usually six)</span> <span style="color: red;">parietal shields</span>  links the third supralabials and separates the posterior azygous head shield from the first body annulus. The nostrils are crescent-shaped and inserted in relatively  <span style="color: green;">short</span>  nasal scales, which are well separated from the oculars, the lip, and each other. There are three supralabials, the third by far the largest. The lower jaw is formed by a somewhat squarish mental, the first, second, and enormous third infralabials, and the enlarged shield-shaped postmental (genial). Posterior to the postmental are two (rarely one) pairs of first postgenials| the medial pair are in contact (sometimes fused) behind the postmental, the lateral pair are in contact with the second infralabials. Immediately caudad to the first row of postgenials is a second row of three to 11 postgenial segments| the larger medial ones border the first postgenials, and the tiny lateral ones border the third infralabial posteriorly. The modified pectoral region extends to the seventh through the eleventh dorsal annulus| there are usually six elongate  <span style="color: green;">rectangular</span>  pectoral shields (the lateral pair may be more or less broken up)| these correspond to four dorsal halfannuli. The midventral segments of the prepectoral annulus are  <span style="color: green;">slightly enlarged</span>  but are not involved with the pectoral shields. There are  <span style="color: green;">170 to 213</span>  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  from the posterior edge of the third infralabial up to (but not including) the precloacal shields. There are  <span style="color: green;">two to 22</span>  <span style="color: red;">supernumerary dorsal half-annuli</span>  Most of these correspond to the first 50  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  although there is usually one extra half-annulus in the precloacal region. A midbody annulus has  <span style="color: green;">17 to 34</span>  dorsal plus 14 to 27  <span style="color: red;">ventral segments</span>  The middorsal segments are approximately three times as long as wide and the mid- <span style="color: red;">ventral segments</span>  three times as wide as long. The number of  <span style="color: red;">dorsal segments</span>  is consistently greater than the number of  <span style="color: red;">ventral segments</span>  for any given specimen. There are generally  <span style="color: green;">three or four (rarely five to seven)</span> <span style="color: red;">lateral annuli</span>  the first one or two in contact with the outer of two or three pairs of enlarged precloacal shields. There are no pre-cloacal pores. The  <span style="color: green;">short</span>  subcylindrical tail is smoothly rounded. There are  <span style="color: green;">five to nine</span>  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  with no autotomy. The caudal cap iS covered with somewhat irregular segments. The  <span style="color: red;">lateral sulci</span>  are well marked, but there are no dorsal or ventral sulci. There are  <span style="color: red;">diagonal folding lines</span>  on the  <span style="color: red;">dorsal surface</span>  of the body. (Broadley et al. 1976: 381)<br>

Monopeltis luandae	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Diagnosis: Gans 1976: 3 Description: Gans 1976: 3Diagnosis. A small to medium-sized (203 to 385 mm. snout-vent length) species of Monopeltis with the (apparently faded) dorsal surface of the trunk and tail speckled with dark pigment that fuses into an accentuated area on the dorsal surface of the tail. The species has 223 to 227 body and 15 or 16 caudal annuli (up to the oval tip that shows some lateral compression), 29 to 36 (generally 30 or 32) dorsal and 14 to 20 ventral segments to a midbody annulus, and four first plus five to eight second postgenial segments. The azygous head shields are discrete at 218 mm. snout-vent length, and show broad isthmus of keratin at 385 mm., but with significant lateral notches in the heavily keratinized shield. There are no preoculars. The posterior processes of the nasals (which segments neither touch each other nor the lip) are excluded from contact with the ocular by a wide contact zone between third supralabial and head shield. The pectoral region is wide and very short. The medial pair of shields is by far the largest. They are widest posteriorly and are joined anteriorly by a second and smaller medial pair (derivative of the first pectoral annulus) that widens anteriorly, with three to five pairs of much smaller shields clustering around the junction. One of the two of these may be replaced by roughly parallel-sided lateral pair flanking the medial shields along their length. The lateral sulci are poorly expressed and the dorsal ones are absent. Both zones show major and crossing diagonal folding lines. Supernumerary dorsal half-annuli number 14 to 19 in the first 50 (14 to 24 in the first 100) body annuli and very few thereafter. The dorsal interannular sutures cross the trunk at right angles to its long axis. There are no precloacal pores. Autotomy occurs at the third to fourth caudal annulus. (Broadley et al. 1976)Description. This is a relatively stout, small to medium-sized species of Monopeltis with the available specimens ranging from 203 to 385 mm. in snout-vent length (fig. 20). Most specimens are badly faded, but parts of USNM 20037 still show definite speckling of melanophores in a middorsal band that starts in the anterior third of the body, extends onto the base of the tail and descends to the level of the lateral sulcus. The dorsal surface of the head is covered by two heavily keratinized azygous head shields in smaller specimens (less than 208 mm. snout-vent). The medial third of the intermediate raphe has fused in larger specimens (greater than 350 mm.), with a heavy build-up of keratin on the anteromedial portion of the anterior and the center of the posterior shield. The medial line of the anterior shield is straight and that of the posterior shield convex| laterally there is a marked convexity anterior to the ocular on each side, providing an anterior exposure for the eye. The eye is clearly visible as a dark spot beneath the quadrilateral ocular in the smaller specimens| only in the largest one is it obscured. The ocular is in contact anteriorly with the first azygous shield, dorsally with the second, ventrally with the third supralabial, and posteriorly with the second of five or six parietal segments. These segments link the third and fourth supralabials on each side and separate the posterior azygous head shields from the segments of the first body annulus. The crescent-shaped nostrils are inserted in medium-sized nasal segments that are well separated from the oculars, the lip, and each other. There are three or four supralabials, the first very small, the second narrow but elongate, and the third (and sometimes fourth) narrow and variably spaced. (The last two, jointly with the most lateral parietal, occupy the space taken by the enlarged third supralabial in other spade-snouted species.) The lower jaw is covered by the squarish mental with flaring anterior edges and the anteriorly concave posterior edge, the first, second, and enormous third infralabials, and the large, heart-shaped postmental (genial) which is in broad contact with the first and second infralabials. The rectangular lateral segments of the first post-genial row contact the second infralabials and postmental| the subquadrangular medial first postgenials have broad contact behind the postmental. A row of five to eight smaller second postgenials follows behind these and the third infralabials just anterior to the deep gular fold. The modified pectoral region extends to the ninth body annulus. The pectoral arrangement involves wedge-shaped, rather than parallel shields. Generally there is a medial pair, much the widest posteriorly, flanked by one or two often shorter sets of enlarged shields on each side. The lateral ones tend to be short and may be broken into one or three separate elements. The set coresponds to four or five body annuli, whereas the one or two more anterior annuli are much widened medially and definitely involved in the formation of the pectoral zone. A pair of medial derivatives of these anterior annuli forms an anterior prolongation of the pectoral shield pattern. There are 223 to 227 body annuli from the posterior edge of the last infralabial up to (but not including) the cloacal shields. Those corresponding to the gular region generally have the dorsal interannular raphes widened and filled with tiny segments, equivalent to but less pronounced than those filling the deep gular folds. There are 14 to 19 supernumerary dorsal half-annuli in the first 50 (14 to 24 in the first 100) body annuli and very few thereafter. A midbody annulus has 29 to 36 (generally 30 or 32) dorsal plus 14 to 20 ventral segments. The middorsal segments are approximately three times as long as wide and the midventral segments one and one-half times as wide as long. The number of dorsal segments is consistently greater than the number of ventrals. There are generally four lateral annuli, the first and/or second in contact with the four segments on the enlarged precloacal shield. There are no precloacal pores. The medium-sized tail is pointed in juveniles and rounded in the larger specimens. There are 15 or 16 caudal annuli, with an autotomy constriction at the third or fourth of these after which the tail tends to be slightly swollen, sometimes increased in dorsoventral dimension and laterally compressed up to the smoothly rounded tip. The shallowly inscribed remnants of annular raphes give this a concentric pattern in distal view. The larger specimens show major damage to parts of the body and tail, with the partial healing covered by geometrically irregular segmentation. The lateral sulci are very narrow and poorly defined| they involve some irregularity and are only one-half as wide as the adjacent segments. The dorsal surface is crossed by many diagonal folding lines, but lacks a dorsal sulcus. The ventral sulcus is only indicated by alignment of intersegmental sutures. (Broadley et al. 1976)<br>

The entire zone iS heavily keratinized, except for a strip along the posterior edge and the concave region immediately anterior to the blind  <span style="color: red;">sutures</span> (and the oculars which lie just posterior to these). The eye is faintly (more so in smaller specimens) visible deep beneath the pentagonal  <span style="color: red;">ocular</span>  that has a  <span style="color: green;">vertical anterior suture</span>  a horizontal one versus the azygous head shield, and a ventral one versus the second and third supralabials, whereas the pointed posterior tip of the  <span style="color: red;">ocular</span>  lies adjacent to the lateralmost of the five to eight (usually  <span style="color: green;">six</span> ) parietals that border the posterior edge of the azygous shield between the third supralabials. The row of parietals separates the shield from the first body annulus. The crescent-shaped nostrils are inserted in medium-sized nasals which are well separated from the oculars, the lip and each other. There are three supralabials| the third by far the largest. The lower jaw is covered by a somewhat squarish mental, the first, second, and enormous third infralabials, and the large, shield-shaped postmental (genial) that may or may not have point contact with the first infralabials.

Monopeltis sphenorhynchus	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Diagnosis. A small to medium-sized ( <span style="color: green;">207 to 326 mm</span>  <span style="color: red;">snout-vent length</span>  in adults) slender form of Monopeltis with the  <span style="color: red;">dorsal surface</span>  <span style="color: green;">immaculate</span>  or marked by only a diffuse scattering of melanophores. Specimens have 228 to 284 body (see geographic variation), three to six lateral and seven to 11 (generally nine) caudal annuli (up to the smoothly rounded tip that may show faint lateral compression), 22 to 37 dorsal (see geographical variation) plus 14 to 26 (generally 16, 18, or 20) ventral segments to a midbody annulus and two (rarely three) large segments to the first plus three to seven (generally five) to the second postgenial row. The  <span style="color: red;">azygous head shields</span>  are  <span style="color: green;">discrete</span>  in juveniles, but almost completely fused in specimens larger than 130 mm. The strongly  <span style="color: red;">keratinized shield</span>  of larger specimens lacks any trace of an ocular notch. The  <span style="color: red;">nasals</span>  <span style="color: green;">do not contact each other or the ocular</span>  from which they are separated by broad contact between the azygous head shield and the second supralabial. They often contact the lip, either anterior to a reduced first supralabial, or by fusion with this (leading to two supralabials). There are six parietal shields. The  <span style="color: red;">pectoral region</span>  is  <span style="color: green;">long and slender</span>  The medial pair of the  <span style="color: red;">six slender shields</span> (which  <span style="color: green;">correspond dorsally to five body annuli</span> ) is longest and extends farthest anteriorly, so that the narrowed last prepectoral annulus makes a short radius curve around the anterior end of the shield. The  <span style="color: red;">lateral sulci</span>  are  <span style="color: green;">poorly expressed</span>  and  <span style="color: red;">dorsal and ventral ones</span>  are  <span style="color: green;">absent</span>  There are diagonal folding lines on the dorsum. Many specimens have no supernumerary dorsal half-annuli| there are never more than three and some specimens show a reduction of up to nine half-annuli. The dorsal interannular sutures cross the trunk at right angles to its long axis. Two large precloacal pores lie on the terminal segments of the first lateral annulus, which are in contact with the large median pair of precloacal shields. No autotomy occurs. (Broadley et al. 1976)Description. This is a medium-sized form of Monopeltis with the available specimens from 104 to 326 mm. in  <span style="color: red;">snout-vent length</span> (fig. 20). The dorsum is marked by a diffuse sprinkling of melanophores, except for the nuchal region and tail, which is  <span style="color: green;">immaculate</span>  The  <span style="color: red;">dorsal surface</span>  of the head is divided into two  <span style="color: green;">discrete</span>  <span style="color: red;">azygous head shields</span>  in small juveniles. These segments are almost completely fused in specimens that exceed 130 mm. in  <span style="color: red;">snout-vent length</span>  In large specimens the strongly  <span style="color: red;">keratinized shield</span>  lacks any a trace of a lateral suture. The head shield is slightly convex in profile. In juveniles the eye can just be distinguished as a dark spot beneath the lozenge-shaped ocular, which makes contact with the second supralabial. A row of six parietals separates the large head shield from the first body annulus. The nostrils are crescent-shaped and inserted into relatively short nasal scales which often border the lip, but are well separated from the ocular and each other. There are usually three supralabials, but the first may be fused with the nasal. The lower jaw is formed by an almost rectangular mental, first, second (often fused with first), and enormous third infralabials, and a rather small heart-shaped postmental (genial). Posterior to the postmental are a pair (rarely three) of large first postgenials in broad medial contact followed by three to seven (usually five) very small second postgenials. The modified  <span style="color: red;">pectoral region</span>  extends from the eighth to eleventh dorsal annulus. There are six elongate segments, the medial pair widest posteriorly and projecting anteriorly so that the narrowed prepectoral annulus curves around them. The lateral pair tend to be broken up. There are 228 to 284 body annuli from the posterior edge of the third infralabial up to (but not including) the precloacal shields. Supernumerary dorsal half-annuli do not exceed three and in nearly 50 percent of the specimens there is actually a reduction a in the number of dorsal half-annuli, reaching a maximum of nine in USNM 58741. A midbody annulus has 22 to 37 dorsal plus 16 to 26 ventral segments. The middorsal segments are approximately four times longer than wide and the midventral segments are approximately one and a-half times to twice as wide as long. The number of dorsal segments is always much greater than the number of ventral segments for any given specimen. There are three to six lateral half-annuli| the enlarged outer segments of the first half-annulus each bear a precloacal pore and are in contact with the very large medial pair of precloacal shields and also a pair of very small lateral precloacal shields. The very short tail is smoothly rounded and appears subcylindrical in cross section. There are seven to 11 caudal annuli with no autotomy. The segments of the caudal cap tend to be fused. The  <span style="color: red;">lateral sulci</span>  are very feebly defined and there are no dorsal or ventral sulci. There are numerous diagonal folding lines on the  <span style="color: red;">dorsal surface</span>  of the body. (Broadley et al. 1976)Description (gazei): “Distinguishable from typical capensis on the following: Large head shield just slightly longer than broad and bordered behind by two pairs of occipitals, of which the inner pair are bandlike and the outer small and quadrangular. A single temporal on each side between the outer occipital and 3rd upper labial, in contact anteriorly with ocular| latter very small and elongate| eye indiscernible| 2nd lower labial not half as large as 1st| mental subpentagonal and followed behind by a pentagonal postmental, which is wedged behind between a single pair of large chin-shields, which are in good contact with all three lower labials on either side| six large. elongate pectorals, median pair equal in length to distance from tip of snout to hinder edge of second annulus on nape, widening considerably behind and there twice anterior width| second pair of pectorals broadest anteriorly, outermost pair divided into several segments of which the longest is from a third to half the length of median pair| 239-264 annuli on body, and 10-11 on tail| each annulus about middle of body made up of 52-54 (i.e. 32 dorsal and 20-22 ventral) segments| the two median rows of ventrals twice as broad as long| a single pair of much enlarged, 5-sided anal plates.

Zygaspis ferox	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Diagnosis. The thing that first drew attention to this taxon was its large size and aggressive behaviour. This is reflected in its relatively massive  <span style="color: red;">skull</span>  laterally  <span style="color: green;">expanded posteriorly</span>  and with  <span style="color: green;">humps</span>  on the fronto-parietal sutures and midway along the  <span style="color: green;">well developed</span>  <span style="color: red;">saggital crest</span>  It has lower counts of body and  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  than adjacent populations of Z. quadrifrons and it differs from Z. nigra and the Z. violacea group in always having six or seven shields in the temporal region.

The only others in this class are three from Lukafu, southern Zaïre (including the holotype of katangae Witte & Laurent) and one Namibian specimen. (BROADLEY & BROADLEY 1997)Colouration. Dorsum light purple-brown, darkening posteriorly, the segments may be darker on the proximal edge: this pigmentation may extend for two or three segments below the lateral sulcus. Otherwise the ventrum is unpigmented anteriorly, but becomes lightly pigmented caudad, especially on the subcaudals, this pigmentation is emphasised on the proximal edge of the segments. The pre-  and postcloacal segments generally lack pigment. (BROADLEY & BROADLEY 1997)Diagnosis (katangae). “Cette sous-espèce se distingue de la forme typique par un nombre moins élevé d'anneaux dans le tronc (197 à 219 au lieu de 221 à 238), un nombre moins élevé de segments dans un anneau médian du tronc (14 à 18 dorsaux (chez un seul exemplaire) au lieu de 18 à 22, et 12 à 16 ventraux (chez un seul exemplaire) au lieu de 16 à 22) , la présence de 6 segments préanaux au lieu de 4, ainsi que de  <span style="color: green;">3</span>  labiales aussi bien supérieures qu'inférieures au lieu de 4.” (Witte & Laurent 1942)<br>

Zygaspis violacea	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Diagnosis. The most derived species of Zygaspis, with fusion of preoculars with prefrontals, parietals with frontals, a single postocular and a single large temporal with which the postsupralabials are fused. This species has lower counts of body annuli and higher counts of caudal annuli (and hence a proportionately longer tail) than any other species in the genus, it is also distinguished from parapatric populations of Z. vandami arenicola by its more numerous segments in a midbody annulus. (BROADLEY & BROADLEY 1997)Description. A small species of Zygaspis which lacks discrete preoculars and parietals and has a single postocular and temporal, supralabials three, postsupralabials fused with temporal| postmental subequal in length to mental or much shorter (type of longicauda)| postgenials in two or three rows, 2 or 3 + 4 to 6| postmalars 7-11| three infralabials, second much the largest.

Amphisbaena cuiabana	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Strüssmann and Carvalho (2001) considered as diagnostic characters for A. cuiabana the presence of four precloacal pores and the highest number of body annuli (286-292) among its congeners. In fact, A. cuiabana only has fewer body annuli than A. supernumeraria (333-337), a northeast Brazilian species of amphisbaenid recently described (Mott et al. 2009). Authors when describing A. cuiabana mentioned the presence of a constriction site on 9th or 10th tail annuli, and they speculate the possibility of tail autotomy in this species, although they could not find any specimen with autotomized tail. With the additional specimens described by Silva et al. 2016, the range of the number of body annuli for A. cuiabana, changes from 282-286 to 278-309, and the tail annuli from 17-20 to 18-20 (with an autotomic site on annulus 8th). The largest specimen known for the species is 316 mm snout-vent length, and it seems that male has longer tails than female. The  <span style="color: red;">nasorostral scale</span>  is fused with  <span style="color: red;">nasals</span>  in some specimens (47 %), but not in all (53 %) as previously noticed by Strüssmann and Carvalho (2001).<br>

<br>
Amphisbaena leali	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Diagnosis: Amphisbaena leali is a moderate- sized (to  <span style="color: green;">254 mm</span>  <span style="color: red;">svl</span> ), robust, longtailed, extensively pigmented species of Amphisbaena with caudal autotomy, without major alterations of the head scales, and with the Y chin configuration. It differs from all other Antillean species in having very  <span style="color: green;">wide, granule-filled</span>  <span style="color: red;">interannular spaces</span>  <span style="color: green;">deepening to pits</span>  between the  <span style="color: green;">medially narrowed</span>  <span style="color: red;">paramedian pairs</span>  of  <span style="color: red;">ventral segments</span>  In being  <span style="color: green;">long</span> -tailed and having large numbers of caudal annuli it is similar to A. caudalis| but in addition to the unique pitting, it differs in being somewhat heavier bodied (Fig. 3B), longer headed (Fig. 4C in THOMAS & HEDGES 2006), and in being extensively pigmented. It further differs from A. caudalis in having a higher number of  <span style="color: red;">cloacals</span> ( <span style="color: green;">19-23</span>  vs. 10-19), and higher number of  <span style="color: red;">total segments</span>  to a midbody annulus ( <span style="color: green;">35-38</span>  vs. 32- 35) (Table 1). The  <span style="color: red;">internasal sutures</span>  of A. leali average  <span style="color: green;">shorter</span>  than the other species of southern Hispaniola, except for A. gonavensis. A few individuals of A. caudalis have somewhat widened  <span style="color: red;">interannular spaces</span>  ventrally, but none have either the extent or the deepness of the depressions characteristic of A. leali. Besides this unique feature, it differs from A. innocens in having longer  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  posteriorly, <span style="color: green;">long</span>  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  and  <span style="color: red;">high number of caudal annuli</span> ( <span style="color: green;">17-20</span>  vs. 10-13), and  <span style="color: green;">small</span>  <span style="color: red;">first infralabials</span> (Fig. 5). In higher “ <span style="color: red;">difference counts</span> ” ( <span style="color: green;">12-25</span>  vs. -2-16) there is no overlap when the comparison is with the distal Tiburon Peninsula A. innocens (-2-7). The second row of postgenials has 4 versus a strong mode of 5 scales in A. innocens. Amphisbaena leali is more extensively and heavily pigmented than the majority of A. innocens, and it has larger hemipenes with greater development of pleats and terminal lamellae.<br>
<br>
Amphisbaena cayemite	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Diagnosis: Amphisbaena cayemite is a moderate-sized (to  <span style="color: green;">220 mm</span>  <span style="color: red;">svl</span> ), robust, relatively long-headed, short-tailed species of Amphisbaena without caudal autotomy, having none of the major alterations of the head scales, and having  <span style="color: red;">chin condition</span>  <span style="color: green;">y</span>  It is uniquely characterized by very long  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  and extremely low body annulus counts ( <span style="color: green;">150-164</span> ), lower than any other Antillean species. Since it is not one of the long-tailed species, it bears comparison principally with A. innocens. Aside from its extremely low body annulus counts, it has high positive “difference counts,” not overlapping with distal Tiburon A. innocens (10- 30 vs. -2-7)| in  <span style="color: red;">posterior annuli</span>  spanned by the jaw measurement, it is also lower than A. innocens ( <span style="color: green;">4.5-5.5</span>  vs. 6-8). Five of the eight A. cayemite have two rows of postgenials, a very rare condition in A. innocens. There is no overlap in the “difference counts” with those of A. innocens from the distal Tiburon Peninsula (10-30 vs. -2-7). In number of  <span style="color: red;">segments to a midbody annulus</span>  A. cayemite is almost completely separable from A. innocens in  <span style="color: red;">total segments</span> ( <span style="color: green;">30-31</span>  vs. <span style="color: green;">31-40</span> ), with only one specimen of A. innocens being at the low extreme of 31. In number of  <span style="color: red;">segments above the lateral fold</span> ( <span style="color: green;">12-13</span>  vs. 13- 18), the same relationship holds| and in  <span style="color: red;">segments below the lateral fold</span> (18) A. cayemite is in the low part of the range of A. innocens.<br>

Amphisbaena fuliginosa	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SPECIES: <span style="color: red;">head</span>  relatively  <span style="color: green;">massive, snout prominent, swollen</span>  <span style="color: red;">body</span>  <span style="color: green;">stocky</span>  <span style="color: red;">total length</span>  of adults usually 350 to 500 mm, one specimen 555 mm. <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  <span style="color: green;">clavate</span> | <span style="color: red;">autotomy annulus</span>  <span style="color: green;">fifth to seventh</span>  <span style="color: red;">rostral</span>  <span style="color: green;">moderate</span>  low. <span style="color: red;">nasals</span>  <span style="color: green;">large, in contact with the second supralabial</span>  <span style="color: red;">prefrontal</span>  <span style="color: green;">moderate</span>  <span style="color: red;">postfrontals</span>  <span style="color: green;">forming together a rough hexagon, wider than long</span>  Three  <span style="color: red;">upper labials</span>  the first smallest, the second and third variously divided and fused, at times suggesting preoculars or anterior suboculars. One  <span style="color: red;">true subocular</span>  above the third labial, which may be horizontally split. Two irregular  <span style="color: red;">temporal series</span>  <span style="color: red;">symphysial</span>  <span style="color: green;">roughly anvil-shaped, sometimes fused with one of the infralabials</span>  which are 3 or 4, at times split or fused. <span style="color: red;">post- <span style="color: red;">symphysial</span> </span>  <span style="color: green;">elongate, sometimes longitudinally split</span>  Remaining  <span style="color: red;">scales of the mental region</span>  <span style="color: green;">variable</span> (Vanzolini 2002).Conclusion of Vanzolini (2002): There is only one species, A. fuliginosa, involved. This species occupies continually one very large area, subdivided into two equally very large adjacent territories, in which occur  <span style="color: green;">two contrasting and well-characterized plant formations, rainforest and cerrado</span>  There is one locality in the Atlantic forest. In the forested  <span style="color: red;">territory</span>  the species is obviously in a stage of  <span style="color: green;">advanced but still incomplete</span>  <span style="color: red;">differentiation</span>  There are broad areas of well defined and characteristic  <span style="color: red;">color patterns</span>  separated by  <span style="color: green;">relatively narrow</span>  <span style="color: red;">transition belts</span>  The data on quantitative characters do not quite permit to say that they are exactly coextensive with that of the color pattern, but the location of the transitional belts is highly suggestive. There are not yet adequate data on cerrado populations. A first impression is, as said, one of strong inter-deme  <span style="color: red;">differentiation</span> (Carson 1987).<br>

Amphisbaena caiari	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Diagnosis: (1) A small sized species, <span style="color: red;">maximum svl</span> = <span style="color: green;">157 mm</span> | (2) two precloacal pores| (3) precloacal pores arranged in a continuous series| (4) snout rounded in lateral and dorsal views| (5) tip of tail rounded| (6) <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  <span style="color: green;">233–250</span> | (7) <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  <span style="color: green;">20–24</span> | (8) <span style="color: red;">autotomy sites on  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span> </span>  <span style="color: green;">6–9</span> | (9) 10 dorsal and 12–14 ventral segments per annulus at midbody| (10) postmalar row absent| (11) suture between frontals slightly smaller than parietal and nasal sutures| (12) <span style="color: red;">tail short relative to body length</span> (tail length/body length = 0.10).Comparisons: Characters from other species are presented in parenthesis. Among the South American two-pored Amphisbaena species, the rounded snout immediately distinguishes the new species from A. cerradensis (Ribeiro, Vaz-Silva and Santos Jr, 2008), A. maxima (Ribeiro, Nogueira, Cintra, Silva and Zaher, 2011) (dorsoventrally compressed, shovel-like snout), A. acrobeles (Ribeiro, Castro-Mello and Nogueira, 2009) and A. bilabialata (Stimson, 1972) (laterally compressed, with a conspicuous vertical keel). The rounded tail diagnoses it from A. absaberi (Strüssmann and Carvalho, 2001), A. bahiana Vanzolini, 1964, A. roberti Gans, 1964, (a sharp terminal vertical keel on tail), A. leeseri Gans, 1964, and A. bilabialata (a blunt terminal vertical keel). The presence of two pores arranged in a continuous series distinguishes the new species from A. absaberi, A. anomala, A. bilabialata, A. carli Pinna, Mendonça, Bocchiglieri & Fernandes, 2010, A. cerradensis, A. hiata Montero & Céspedez, 2002, and A. maxima (scales bearing pores separated from each other by one or more non-pored scales).Among the remaining two-pored, South American species of Amphisbaena, the occurrence of  <span style="color: green;">233–250</span>  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  distinguishes the new species from A. anaemariae Vanzolini, 19697, A. brevis Strüssmann & Mott, 2009, A. crisae Vanzolini, 1997, A. darwini Duméril and Bibron, 1839, A. dubia Müller, 1924, A. heterozonata Burmeister, 1861, A. mitchelli, A. neglecta Dunn and Piatt, 1936, and A. silvestrii Boulenger, 1902 (< 231  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span> ) and from A. miringoera Vanzolini, 1971 (> 250  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span> ). The occurrence of  <span style="color: green;">20–24</span>  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  differs from counts of A. anaemariae, A. brevis, A. dubia, A. heterozonata and A. neglecta (< 20  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span> ) and A. mitchelli (> 26  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span> ). The occurrence of the autotomic site in  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  <span style="color: green;">6–9</span>  differs from the condition found in A. anaemarie, A. brevis, A. crisae, A. dubia, A. leeseri, A. neglecta and A. silvestrii (autotomy site absent or in an anterior to caudal annulus 6). The presence of 10 dorsal and 12–14 ventral segments differs from all other two-pored species (> 10 dorsal or > 14 ventral segments| < 12 ventral segments in A. crisae), with the exception of A. silvestrii (10–12 dorsal and 10–14 ventral segments). Also, the new species can be distinguished from A. darwini, A. heterozonata, and A. lumbricalis Vanzolini, 1996 by having a fixed number of 2 pores (2–6 pores), and from A. dubia (0 or 2 pores). Additionally, A. caiari sp. nov. can be distinguished from A. crisae, A. darwini and A. dubia by the absence of postmalars (present) (Fig. 3). From A. anaemariae, A. crisae, A. darwini, A. heterozonata and A. lumbricalis, the new species differs by having a suture between prefrontals that is smaller than the suture between the frontals (suture between prefrontals larger than between frontals) (Fig. 3). In having having TL/BL = 0.10, it differs from A. anaemariae, A. darwini, A. mitchelli, A. silvestrii, and A. crisae (0.13–0.16 TL/BL) and A. carli (0.06 TL/BL) (Fig. 4).A few additional species were also recorded in the same geographic region where the new species was found: Amphisbaena alba Linnaeus 1758, A. fuliginosa, and A. cunhai Hoogmoed & Avila-Pires, 1991. Amphisbaena caiari sp. nov. can be distinguished from those species by the presence of two pores (> 4), the occurrence of  <span style="color: green;">20–24</span>  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span> (≥ 24 in all species except A. alba, which has ≤ 21)| and the presence of 10 dorsal and 12–14 ventral segments (> 14 dorsal and ventral segments). Also, the maximum known SVL of  <span style="color: green;">157 mm</span>  in the new species is smaller than in other species (> 400 mm SVL).<br>

A member of the Z. quadrifrons group, distinguished from quadrifrons by its large size, low number of body annuli and elongate postmental. It differs from Z. nigra in having head shields in the temporal region unfused. It differs from Z. ferox in having only 28-32 segments to a midbody annulus (vs 34-40). It differs from Z. kafuensis in lacking a short blind nasal sulcus and in its more robust build (SVL/diameter 25-33 vs 35-40). (BROADLEY & BROADLEY 1997)Description.

Amphisbaena persephone	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Diagnosis: Amphisbaena persephone is diagnosable from all other congeners by the following combination of characters: (1) rounded snout| ( <span style="color: green;">2</span> ) slender body (Table 1)| (3) lateral and dorsal sulci well visible| (4) two rounded  <span style="color: red;">precloacal pores</span>  medially located| () 230–241  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span> | (6) 19–22  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span> | (7) 12–14 dorsal and 14 ventral segments to a midbody annulus| (8) tail with a marked autotomic constriction at  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  6–8| (9) tail tip laterally compressed| (10) three supralabials followed by one postsupralabial, and three infralabials followed by one post- infralabial on each side of the head.By the presence of two  <span style="color: red;">precloacal pores</span>  Amphisbaena persephone differs from all the other rounded-snout species of Amphisbaena, except: A. absaberi (Strüssmann and Carvalho, 2001)| A. anaemariae Vanzolini, 1997| A. brevis Strüssmann and Mott, 2009| A. carli Pinna, Mendonc ̧a, Bocchiglieri, and Fernandes, 2010| A. crisae Vanzolini, 1997| A. cuiabana (Strüssmann and Carvalho,2001)| A. darwini Duméril and Bibron, 1839| A. dubia Müller, 1924| A. heterozonata Burmeister, 1861| A. hiata Montero and Ce ́spedez, 2002| A. leeseri Gans, 1964a| A. lumbricalis Vanzolini, 1996| A. miringoera Vanzolini, 1971| A. mitchelli Procter, 1923| A. neglecta Dunn and Piatt, 1936| A. roberti Gans, 1964c| and A. silvestrii Boulenger, 1902.Among the species mentioned above, Amphisbaena persephone sp. nov. differs from A. absaberi, A. carli, and A. hiata by having no median hiatus between the  <span style="color: red;">precloacal pores</span> (compared to pores separated from each other by a median hiatus in the latter species). The new species differs from A. anaemariae, A. brevis, A. crisae, A. darwini, A. heterozonata, A. mitchelli, A. neglecta, and A. silvestrii in having a greater number of  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span> (230– 241, compared to fewer than 220 in the latter species). The new species differs from A. cuiabana in having a smaller number of  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span> (230–241, compared to more than 280 in the latter species). The presence of a well-marked dorsal sulcus (at least after the first third of the body) in A. persephone sp. nov. differentiates it from A. dubia, A. leeseri, and A. lumbricalis (wherein no dorsal sulcus is present). Compared to A. miringoera, the new species has a smaller number of  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span> (20–264 and 230–241, respectively) and a laterally compressed tail tip (rounded in A. miringoera). Finally, A. persephone sp. nov. differs from A. roberti by having a laterally compressed tail tip (but without a distinct keel) composed of flat-surfaced segments and a marked autotomic constriction at  <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span>  6–8 (compared to a distinct transversal keel composed of conical segments on the tip of the tail and a faint or absent autotomic constriction in A. roberti). Furthermore, A. persephone sp. nov. often presents a smaller number of  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span> (230–241) and dorsal segments (ca.12) to a midbody annulus (compared to 232–26  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  and 13–16 dorsal segments in A. roberti).<br>

Leposternon bagual	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Diagnosis: Leposternon bagual sp. nov. is a medium-sized amphisbaenian (largest specimen total length 309.5 mm) and can be characterized as a Leposternon and distinguished from all South American amphisbaenians by having the nostril openings on the ventral surface of  <span style="color: red;">snout</span>  <span style="color: red;">rostral</span>  and nasals fused into a single shield, gular portion without segmental cover and prefrontal bones in facial view with  <span style="color: red;">nasal</span>  process long and ‘T’ shaped (details of skull in Gans & Montero 2009) (Ribeiro et al. 2008). Additionally, the new species differs from all other South American amphisbaenians, except Leposternon spp. and Amphisbaena anomala (Barbour, 1914), in having the frontal portion of the head greatly depressed and pectoral shields irregular (not arranged in dermal regular annuli). It differs from the other species of the genus by the presence of  <span style="color: red;">rostral</span>  processes in the maxillae and nasals that contact each other in the facial portion of the skull (Fig. 3, Table  <span style="color: green;">1</span> ). The new species further differs from L. cerradensis Ribeiro, Vaz-Silva & Santos-Jr, 2008, L. infraorbitale (Berthold, 1859), L. microcephalum, L. octostegum (Duméril, 1851), L. scutigerum (Hemprich, 1820) and L. wuchereri (Peters, 1879) by the presence of 3 infralabial shields| and from L. cerradensis, L. kisteumacheri Porto, Soares & Caramaschi, 2000, L. maximus Ribeiro, Nogueira, Cintra, Silva Jr. & Zaher, 2011, and L. polystegum (Duméril, 1851) by lacking precloacals pores.Leposternon bagual is further characterized by the following combination of pholidotic, meristic, cranial, and morphometric characters (see also Table  <span style="color: green;">1</span>  for a synthesis of diagnostic features within the genus): <span style="color: green;">1</span> ) two  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span> | 2) supraocular present| 3) 240–267 dorsal postpectoral half-annuli| 4) 206–214 ventral postpectoral half-annuli| 5) 11–12 tail annuli| 6) 27–29 dorsal segments in midbody half- <span style="color: red;">annulus</span> | 7) 23–27 ventral segments in midbody half- <span style="color: red;">annulus</span> | 8) 96 precloacal vertebrae| 9) many  <span style="color: green;">small</span>  and irregularly shaped pectoral shields (Fig. 1D)| 10) adults specimens dark brown dorsally| 11) five premaxillary teeth| 12) four maxillary teeth| 13) six dentary teeth| 14) <span style="color: red;">rostral</span>  process of  <span style="color: red;">nasal</span>  present| 15) <span style="color: red;">rostral</span>  process of maxilla present| 16) premaxillary foramina present| 17) head length with 3.5–4.5% of  <span style="color: red;">snout</span> -vent length| 18) rostronasal length with 22.6–23.5% of head length| 19) rostronasal width with 64.0–68. <span style="color: green;">1</span> % of the greatest width of head| 20) azygous length with 29.3–35.0% of head length| 21) azygous width representing 35.6–45.8% of the greatest width of head| 22) frontal suture length with 25.3–25.5% of head length| 23) parietal suture with 9.8–13.9% of head length| 24) temporal length with 18.9– 22.0% of head length| 25) temporal width with 13.2–17.8% of head width| 26) prefrontals length with 23.0–26.8% of head length| 27) prefrontals width with 38.3–41.7% of head width| 28) height posterior of head comprising 69.0–72.5% of head length| 30) comissure of the mouth length comprising 53.4–59. <span style="color: green;">1</span> % of head length| 29) midbody width with 3.2–4.4% of  <span style="color: red;">snout</span> -vent length| and 30) tail length representing 4.9–5.6% of  <span style="color: red;">snout</span> -vent length.<br>

Amphisbaena metallurga	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Diagnosis: Amphisbaena metallurga sp. nov. is diagnosed by the following combination of characters: ( <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">1</span> </span> ) <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">head</span> </span>  round-shaped| (2) two or three precloacal pores sequentially arranged| ( <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">3</span> </span> ) 190–199  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span> </span> | (4) 2– <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">3</span> </span>  lateral annuli| (5) 23–25  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span> </span> | (6) autotomy plan on 7th – 9th caudal annulus| (7) 12–14 dorsal segments on midbody annulus| (8) 14–16 ventral segments on midbody annulus| (9) three supralabials| (10) three infralabials| (11) postmalar row usually present| (12) body slenderness proportion from 32.6 to 38. <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">3</span> </span> | (13) dorsum of preserved specimens light brown, with cream intersegmental sutures| (14) venter of preserved specimens cream colored.Comparison with other species. The presence of two or three precloacal pores makes Amphisbaena metallurga sp. nov. readily distinguishable from all South American congeners with the exception of A. absaberi, A. anaemariae, A. anomala, A. angustifrons, A. bilabialata, A. bolivica, A. brevis, A. caiari, A. camura, A.carli, A. cerradensis, A. crisae, A. cuiabana, A. darwinii, A. dubia, A. heterozonata, A. hiata, A. kisteumacheri, A. leeseri, A. lumbricalis, A. maxima, A. miringoera, A. mitchelli, A. neglecta, A. persephone, A. polystega, A. roberti and A. silvestrii. Among these species (characters inside parentheses), the rounded  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">head</span> </span>  easily distinguishes Amphisbaena metallurga sp. nov. from A. anomala, A. cerradensis, A. kisteumacheri, A. maxima, A. polystega ( <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">head</span> </span>  shovel-shaped) and A. bilabialata ( <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">head</span> </span>  keel-shaped). Therefore, these six species are excluded from following comparisons.The rounded  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">tail</span> </span>  distinguishes Amphisbaena metallurga sp. nov. from A. trachura (caudal tip tuberculate), A. absaberi, A. cuiabana and A. roberti ( <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">tail</span> </span>  with a terminal vertical keel). The rostral without median contact with prefrontals distinguishes Amphisbaena metallurga sp. nov. from A. carli (rostral in broad contact with prefrontals). The presence of precloacal pores arranged in sequence distinguishes Amphisbaena metallurga sp. nov. from A. absaberi, A. carli and A. hiata (precloacal pores separated from each other by segments).The presence of 190–199  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span> </span>  distinguishes Amphisbaena metallurga sp. nov. from A. absaberi (239–242), A. anaemaeriae (156–170), A. bolivica (200–231), A. brevis (139), A. caiari (233–250), A. carli (221–248), A. crisae (180–185), A. cuiabana (283–320), A. dubia (211– 231), A. hiata (202–213), A. leeseri (216–249), A. lumbricalis (225–247), A. miringoera (250–264), A. mitchelli (203–220), A. neglecta (151–161), A. persephone (230–241) and A. roberti (232–265). The presence of 23–25  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span> </span>  distinguishes Amphisbaena metallurga sp. nov. from A. absaberi (14–15), A. anaemaeriae (18–20), A. angustifrons (12–18), A. brevis (9), A. camura (14–19), A. carli (10–14), A. crisae (20–22), A. cuiabana (17–21), A. dubia (13–18), A. heterozonata (13–18), A. hiata (17–19), A. leeseri (14–19), A. mitchelli (26– 29), A. neglecta (14–16) , A. persephone (19–22) and A. roberti (17–20). Autotomy in annuli 7–9 distinguishes Amphisbaena metallurga sp. nov. from A. absaberi (5–6), A. anaemaeriae ( <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">3</span> </span> –5), A. angustifrons (autotomy absent), A. bolivica ( <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">3</span> </span> –5), A. camura ( <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">3</span> </span> –5), A. carli (autotomy absent), A. crisae (4–6), A. dubia (autotomy absent), and A. neglecta (4–6).The presence of 12–14 dorsal segments distinguishes Amphisbaena metallurga sp. nov. from A. brevis (18) and A. caiari (10). The number of both dorsal and ventral segments (12–14 / 14– 16) distinguishes the new species from A. absaberi (16–19 / 17–20), A. angustifrons (20–31 / 21–30), A. bolivica (27–38 / 26–36), A. camura (28–42 / 29–46), A. carli (20–23 / 18–23), A. crisae (10 / 10) and A. hiata (16–18 / 18–22). A summary of morphological characters for two-pored and three-pored Amphisbaena is provided in Table SI.Despite the differences above mentioned, the new species is more similar to Amphisbaena darwinii, A. heterozonata, A. prunicolor, A. trachura and A. silvestrii in the traditional meristic data, but can be further distinguished by the following characters: From A. prunicolor by the number of precloacal pores (two or three in A. metallurga sp. nov. and four in A. prunicolor), and color pattern (light brown dorsally and cream ventrally in A. metallurga sp. nov., and dark brown dorsally and ventrally (sometimes checkered) in A. prunicolor) (see Perez et al. 2012 for pictures of A. prunicolor). From A. silvestrii the new species can be distinguished by the shape of the third infralabial (as long as the third supralabial in A. metallurga sp. nov. and about  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">1</span> </span> .5–2 times longer than the third supralabial in A. silvestrii), and color pattern (dark brown dorsally and ventrally in A. silvestrii). Additionally, A. metallurga sp. nov. usually presents a postmalar row (see Table I for exceptions), absent in A. silvestrii.Specimens of A. darwinii, A. heterozonata and A. trachura usually present four precloacal pores, but some A. darwinii and A. heterozonata have two or three and some A. trachura have three pores, as in A. metallurga sp. nov. In this case, A. metallurga sp. nov. can be distinguished from A. darwinii, A. heterozonata and A. trachura by the color pattern. Dorsally, preserved specimens of those three species are dark brown, while A. metallurga sp. nov. is light brown. Additionally, A. trachura presents a tuberculate caudal tip, absent in specimens of the new species, and A. heterozonata has a fewer number of  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span> </span> (see above).Revised Diagnosis: Amphisbaena metallurga can be distinguished from A. albocingulata by having parietals shorter than frontals (parietals as long as frontals in A. albocingulata) and the post-malar row present in 93% of known specimens (absent in A. albocingulata). Although there is an overlap in the number of midbody ventral segments in the two species, the modal value in A. albocingulata is 17, while in A. metallurga it is 14 segments.Amphisbaena metallurga can be distinguished from A. darwinii, A. heterozonata, and A. trachura by the number of midbody dorsal/ventral segments. Although there is an overlap in counts, the modal number of segments is lower in A. metallurga (range: 12–14/14–16| modal: 12/14) than in A. darwinii (range: 13–19/15–23| modal: 16/20), A. heterozonata (range: 14–24/15–28| modal: 16/18), and A. trachura (range: 14–21/16–24| modal: 16,18/22). Amphisbaena metallurga also has more  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span> </span> (23–25) than A. heterozonata (13–18), and a smooth  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">tail</span> </span>  tip (tuberculate in A. trachura)| and it is smaller than those species (maximum/mean  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">svl</span> </span>  179/151 mm in A. metallurga, 304/195 mm in A. darwinii, 277/201 mm in A. heterozonata, and 286/207 mm in A. trachura).Amphisbaena metallurga differs from A. prunicolor in color pattern (uniform dark brown, sometimes with a checkered pattern in the latter), and in the modal number of ventral segments at midbody (14 vs. 16). It differs from A. hogei by having more  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">caudal annuli</span> </span> (23–25 vs. 15–19) and larger size (max/mean. <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">svl</span> </span>  179/151 mm vs. 134/112 mm [based on the type series]). Finally, it differs from A. munoai by the lower modal number of ventral segments at midbody (14 vs. 16) and the absence of a concavity in the top of  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">head</span> </span>  where the prefrontals meet the frontals (Costa et al. 2019).<br>

Zygaspis maraisi	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Diagnosis: Similar to other species of Zygaspis, the diagnostic feature of Z. maraisi sp. nov. is its extensive black pigmentation, with only the  <span style="color: red;">chin area</span>  being  <span style="color: green;">white</span> (Z. nigra, the only partly-coloured species, develops increasing black pigment as it grows, but adults have only the anterior 90% of each dorsal segment black, while no ventral segments are more than 50% black). It agrees with the Z. quadrifrons complex in having paired discrete preoculars. The new species further differs from Z. nigra, in having the  <span style="color: red;">third supralabial</span>  <span style="color: green;">followed by two temporals and two post-supralabials</span>  It differs from most Z. quadrifrons in having  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  <span style="color: green;">less than 200</span>  It differs from Z. kafuensis in lacking a short blind sulcus extending from the rear edge of the nasal towards the nostril. It differs from Z. ferox in having only 32 segments in a mid-body annulus, and being more slender, with a smaller head. It differs from Z. dolichomenta in having the post- mental  <span style="color: green;">barely longer than the mental</span> Loveridge (1941) recorded 221–242  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  in Zygaspis [Amphisbaena] q. quadrifrons and 198–221 in A. q. capensis (now synonymised with Z. quadrifrons), and these figures were repeated by Fitzsimons (1943), who reported an ‘overlap’ between the two subspecies in the Kalahari. Jacobsen (1989) recorded 190–228 (mostly 200–220) <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  for Z. quadrifrons in the North-West and Limpopo Provinces (for- merly Transvaal). Broadley and Broadley (1997) recorded 195–245 (usually 207–245) <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  for Z. quadrifrons throughout its range (N = 982).<br>

Leposternon mineiro	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Diagnosis (Characters of Others Species in Parentheses). Leposternon mineiro sp. nov. is a medium-sized amphisbaenian, largest specimen total length 366.8 mm, and differs from all other South American amphisbaenians, except Leposternon spp. and Amphisbaena anomala (Barbour, 1914) in having only the frontal portion of facial section of head depressed (Fig. 1B), pectoral shields with an irregular form, and dermal annuli not regularly arranged (Fig. 2A) (head compressed or rounded and pectoral shields arranged in regular annuli). It differs from A. anomala mainly by having the  <span style="color: red;">rostral</span>  and nasals fused into a single shield, with nostrils opening on the ventral surface of  <span style="color: red;">snout</span> (Fig. 1C) and autotomic site absent (nasals distinct of  <span style="color: red;">rostral</span>  and autotomic site present). Leposternon mineiro sp. nov. can be distinguished from all congeners, except L. cerradensis, L. kisteumacheri, L. maximus, and L. polystegum, in having two precloacal pores and pectoral shields that are mostly diamond shaped (Fig. 2A) (pores and mostly diamond-shaped pectoral shields absent in L. bagual, L. infraorbitale, L. microcephalum, L. octostegum, L. scutigerum, and L. wuchereri| Table  <span style="color: green;">1</span> ).

The azygous head shields are discrete in some juveniles, whereas others retain short blind lateral sutures. Larger specimens lack even lateral notches for the oculars in the strongly keratinized head shield. The nasals do not contact each other or the lip| their elongate posterior processes (sometimes broken off to form postnasals) always contact the quadrangular ocular. There are four to six parietals. The pectoral region is long and slender. The medial pair of the six slender shields (which correspond dorsally to four or five  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span> ) is the longest and extends anteriorly so that the narrowed last prepectoral annulus makes a short radius curve round it. The lateral sulci are often poorly expressed and dorsal and ventral ones are absent. There are diagonal folding lines on the dorsum. Many specimens have no supernumerary dorsal half-annuli| the maximum number is 16, but there may be a reduction of up to seven half-annuli. The dorsal interannular sutures Cross the trunk at right angles to its long axis. Two large precloacal pores lie on the terminal  <span style="color: red;">segments</span>  of the first lateral annulus, which are in contact with the large median pair of precloacal shields. No autotomy occurs. (Broadley et al. 1976)Description. This is a medium-sized form of Monopeltis with the available specimens ranging from 105 to 365 mm. snout-vent length (fig. 20). The dorsal surface may have a diffuse sprinkling of melanophores, but is more often immaculate. The dorsal surface of the head is divided into two discrete azygous shields in some juveniles, whereas others retain short blind lateral sutures. Larger specimens have strongly keratinized head shields with no lateral sutures or indentations for the oculars. The head shield may be distinctly convex in profile, but is more often slightly convex posteriorly and concave anteriorly. In juveniles the eye can be distinguished deep beneath the anterior end of an elongate, curved striplike ocular, which is in contact anteriorly with both a small postnasal (sometimes fused with the nasal) and the second supralabial, whereas posteriorly it contacts the medial pair of four to six parietals. A triangular subocular shield is wedged between it and the third supralabial. The nostrils are crescent-shaped and inserted in elongate nasal scales that are in contact (or fused) with the postnasals, but separated from the lip and each other. There are three supralabials. The lower jaw is formed by pentagonal mental, first, second (very small), and enormous third infralabials and a shield shaped postmental (genial). Posterior to the postmental are one (rarely two) pair(s) of large first postgenials in broad median contact, followed by three to seven (generally five) small second postgenials. The modified pectoral region extends to the eighth to eleventh dorsal annulus. There are six elongate  <span style="color: red;">segments</span> | those of the medial pair are widest posteriorly and taper anteriorly, where they project into the prepectoral annulus, the midventral  <span style="color: red;">segments</span>  of which make a short radius curve around them. There are 276 to 316  <span style="color: red;">body annuli</span>  from the posterior edge of the third infralabial up to (but not including) the precloacal shields. Supernumerary dorsal half-annuli are generally few, but reach a maximum of 16 in TM 42411, whereas other specimens show a reduction in dorsal half-annuli of up to seven. A midbody annulus has 30 to 42 dorsal plus 16 to 29 ventral  <span style="color: red;">segments</span>  The middorsal  <span style="color: red;">segments</span>  are approximately five times as long as wide and midventral  <span style="color: red;">segments</span>  are approximately one and a-half times as wide as long. The number of dorsal  <span style="color: red;">segments</span>  is always much greater (nearly twice) than the number of ventral  <span style="color: red;">segments</span>  for any given specimen. There are four to seven lateral half-annuli, the enlarged outer or penultimate  <span style="color: red;">segments</span>  of the first half-annulus each bear a precloacal pore and are usually in contact with both pairs of pre-cloacal shields (rarely fused with the outer pair). The very short  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  is smoothly rounded and appears subcylindrical in cross section although often showing dorsal and ventral grooves. There are seven to 10 caudal annuli with no autotomy. The  <span style="color: red;">segments</span>  of the caudal cap tend to be fused. The lateral sulci are ill defined and there are no dorsal or ventral sulci. There are diagonal folding lines on the dorsal surface of the body. (Broadley et al. 1976)<br>
