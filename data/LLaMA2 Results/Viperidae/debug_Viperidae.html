Agkistrodon contortrix	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis (contortrix): Combining characteristics for the subspecies A. c. contortrix, A. c. mokason, and A. phaegaster, we provide a diagnosis for A. contortrix. We find that the eastern copperhead (A. contortrix) is a medium-sized pit viper with an average adult size of 61– 90 cm and a  <span style="color: red;">maximum size</span>  of  <span style="color: green;">132.1 cm</span> (Gloyd & Conant, 1990| Conant & Collins, 1991), with a ratio of tail to total length of 0.11–0.17 in males and 0.11– 0.16 in females. There is a single anal plate, keeled dorsal scales and typically 23  <span style="color: red;">midbody scale rows</span> (range  <span style="color: green;">21–25</span> | Gloyd & Conant, 1990). Subcaudals range from 38 to 59 in males and from 37 to 49 in females, whereas  <span style="color: red;">ventral scales</span>  number  <span style="color: green;">139–157</span>  with no variation between sexes (Gloyd & Conant, 1990) <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span>  and  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span>  range from  <span style="color: green;">6 to 10</span> (mode 8) and from  <span style="color: green;">8 to 12</span> (mode 10), respectively, and total  <span style="color: red;">postoculars + suboculars</span>  range from  <span style="color: green;">3 to 6</span> (mode 4| Gloyd & Conant, 1990). A combination of geography and colour pattern distinguishes the eastern copperhead from related species. There are 10–21 dark crossbands on a brown, tan or grey background (or very dark or black individuals) in males (10–17 in A. laticinctus) and 11–20 in females (10–18 in A. laticinctus) <span style="color: red;">cross-bands</span>  are narrow at the midbody and widen toward the sides, described as  <span style="color: green;">hourglass or dumbbell shaped</span>  and may be broken at middorsum (Gloyd & Conant, 1990), whereas they generally do not narrow at the midbody in A. laticinctus. The head is coppery brown or reddish–brown with a pale cheek stripe (Gloyd & Conant, 1990). The approximate range of this species extends from Connecticut to Florida along the Atlantic coast, west to include eastern Texas north through eastern Oklahoma into eastern Kansas, where A. laticinctus ranges from eastern Texas north to eastern Kansas (Fig. 5A). Hybridization with the broad-banded copperhead apparently occurs along an ecological transition zone from south-eastern Texas north to eastern Kansas, defined by an increasing elevation, decreasing precipitation, and transition from mixed forest and cypress swamp to prairie grassland (Bailey, 1995). Diagnosis may be difficult for some individuals in this area without additional molecular or morphological data and analyses (Fig. 5A) [BURBRINK & GUIHER 2014].<br>

<br>
Agkistrodon piscivorus	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis (piscivorus): Combining characteristics for the subspecies Agkistrodon piscivorus piscivorus and Agkistrodon piscivorus leucostoma, we provide a diagnosis for A. piscivorus. The Northern Cottonmouth (A. piscivorus) is a mediumto large-bodied semi-aquatic pit viper with an average adult  <span style="color: red;">size</span>  of  <span style="color: green;">76–114 cm</span>  and a  <span style="color: red;">maximum  <span style="color: red;">size</span> </span>  of  <span style="color: green;">188 cm</span> (Gloyd & Conant, 1990| Conant & Collins, 1991), with a ratio of  <span style="color: red;">tail to total length</span>  of  <span style="color: green;">0.13–0.19</span>  in males and 0.12–0.18 in females. They possess a single anal plate, keeled dorsal scales and typically 25  <span style="color: red;">midbody scale rows</span> (range  <span style="color: green;">23–27</span> | Gloyd & Conant, 1990) <span style="color: red;">subcaudals</span>  range from  <span style="color: green;">38 to 53</span>  in males and from 42 to 53 in females, whereas  <span style="color: red;">ventral scales</span>  number  <span style="color: green;">128–142</span>  with no variation between sexes (Gloyd & Conant, 1990) <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span>  and  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span>  range from  <span style="color: green;">6 to 10</span> (mode 8) and  <span style="color: green;">8 to 12</span> (mode 11), respectively and total  <span style="color: red;">postoculars + suboculars</span>  range from  <span style="color: green;">1 to 4</span> (mode 3| Gloyd & Conant, 1990). A combination of geography and colour pattern distinguishes the Northern Cottonmouth from the Florida Cottonmouth. There are  <span style="color: green;">10–17</span>  <span style="color: green;">dark</span>  <span style="color: red;">cross-bands</span>  on an  <span style="color: green;">olive, brown or black</span>  <span style="color: red;">background</span>  whereas A. conanti features 11–16 crossbands. Crossbands in A. piscivorus are often indistinguishable from the ground colour in adults, yet may be prominent or subdued in adult A. conanti. The  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  is typically  <span style="color: green;">black or brown</span>  lacking vertical rostral stripes| a  <span style="color: green;">dark</span>  <span style="color: red;">cheek stripe</span>  is present in juveniles but may be subdued or indistinguishable from the ground colour in adults yet often present in adult A. conanti (Gloyd & Conant, 1990| Conant & Collins, 1991, BURBRINK & GUIHER 2014).<br>

Bitis rubida	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: “Bitis rubida is characterized by lacking, or having greatly reduced, elongate scales (*horns') in the supraorbital region, and by having a drab, usually reddish, dorsal colouration. It can be distinguished from other small Bits by various scutellation features. It differs from B. xeropaga in having fewer ASR than MSR (ASR equal to or greater in number than MSR in B. xeropaga| Haacke 1975), and lower ventral scale counts in both sexes (B. xeropaga males 147-154, mean 151.5| females 151-155, mean 152.4| Haacke 1975). It differs from B. atropos in having a raised supraorbital ridge. It differs from sympatric and southern populations of Bitis cornuta in having lower ventral scale counts in both sexes, fewer circumorbitals, and usually 29 MSR. Bitis cornuta usually has 27 MSR and a slightly higher number of dorsal blotches. It also differs from B. rubida in always having prominent supraorbital a 'horns' and usually a contrasting colour pattern of grey, white and black (reddish in a population near Lang Hoogte, 35 km east Kleinsee). Bitis rubida does not occur in sympatry with B. atropoides, which is restricted to coastal regions of the south-western Cape. The latter has much lower ventral scale counts (115-128), slightly lower subcaudal counts and rictals, usually 27 MSR, and a higher number of circumorbitals. B. atropoides also usually has obvious supraorbital 'horns' (although these are less well developed than in B. cornuta), as well as a grey-black-white colouration (that is less well defined than that of B. cornuta). Bitis inornata and B. albanica are restricted to the Eastern Cape Province and are well isolated from the western taxa, including B. rubida. The two eastern species are distinguished by having short tails in males, in which the hemipenes reach only the 6-7th subcaudal (9-10 subcaudal in the other taxa). Supraocular 'horns' are greatly reduced or absent in B. albanica, which also has a bold, contrasting, grey-black-white colour pattern, with fewer dorsal blotches than in the western taxa. Bitis inornata completely lacks supraorbital 'horns', and has a very drab yellowish-brown coloration, in which the dorsal blotches are greatly reduced or absent. The eastern taxa are allopatric and separated from one another by 150 km.” (Branch 1997)<br>

<br>
Bothrops ammodytoides	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis (genus): Rhinocerophis differs from other South American pitvipers in 27 mitochondrial characters, and in having few ( <span style="color: green;">1 or 2</span> ) <span style="color: red;">palatine teeth</span> (versus 3–6 teeth), which is a morphological synapomorphy (Table 4). Distribution in southern South America, combined with terrestrial habitat in open areas, grasslands, swamps, or broad-leaf and Araucaria forests, distinguishes this genus from others (see Table 4). Rhinocerophis individuals have the  <span style="color: red;">maxillary fang</span>  <span style="color: green;">shorter than the height of the maxilla</span>  and show  <span style="color: green;">black bars</span>  on the  <span style="color: red;">gular scales</span>  of some species (R. alternatus, R. cotiara, R. fonsecai, and R. jonathani). Rhinocerophis have fewer subcaudals (25– 55) than the other genera (31–86), and some specimens have high numbers of  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span> ( <span style="color: green;">7–10</span>  also seen in Bothropoides| other South American genera have 7–8). Rhinocerophis differs from Bothrops and Bothriopsis in having the  <span style="color: red;">prelacunal scale</span>  <span style="color: green;">separated from the second supralabial</span>  It differs from Bothriopsis in the lack of green coloration, and in the lack of a prehensile tail. It differs from Bothrocophias in the lack of tuberculate keels on posterior dorsal scales. Almost all species differ from Bothrocophias in colour pattern: whereas Bothrocophias species have spadeshaped dorsal markings lacking spots between the spades, Rhinocerophis species have spots between the spades (R. alternatus, R. cotiara, and R. fonsecai), have trapezoidal markings with spots between them (R. itapetiningae), or have a checkered pattern (R. ammodytoides). Only R. jonathani lacks spots between spades, but it can be distinguished by the presence of  <span style="color: green;">black bars</span>  on the  <span style="color: red;">gular scales</span>  as mentioned above.<br>
<i>subcaudals: 25–55</i><br>
<br>
Bothrocophias andianus	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: Bothrops andianus is distinguished from all congeners and from species of Bothrocophias and Bothriopsis by the following combination of characters: (1) lacunolabial present| (2) dorsal keels nontuberculate| (3) infralabials and gulars immaculate in adults| (4) canthorostrals absent| (5) most subcaudals divided| (6) ventrals 166–179 and subcaudals 49–63| (7) <span style="color: red;">loreal</span>  <span style="color: green;">subrectangular and elongate</span> | (8) canthals moderate and separated by 3–5 scales| (9) internasals separated by 1–3 scales, rarely (9%) in contact| (10) <span style="color: red;">postocular stripe</span>  <span style="color: green;">distinct and black</span> | (11) <span style="color: red;">dorsum</span>  <span style="color: green;">dull green to brown</span>  with pattern of  <span style="color: green;">subtriangular blotches or french telephone-shaped marks</span> | black edging of  <span style="color: red;">dorsal blotches</span>  becoming 2–4 distinctive rows of black blotches on posterior body and base of tail (Harvey 2005: 13).<br>
<i>black edging: 2-4 distinctive rows of black blotches on posterior body and base of tail</i><br>

Bothrops asper	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: “De esta especie se revisaron 20 especímenes, 10 hembras y 10 machos provenientes todos de distintas localidades del departamento de Cauca al Oeste de la Cordillera Occidental y uno de Tumaco en la Costa Pacífica de Nariño (Mapas 1 y 2). Los ejemplares adultos son robustos y en el dorso presentan de 18 a 25 figuras triangulares oscuras (negro a café) en forma de equis, mariposas o corbatines| con bordes claros (gris a crema) a cada lado del cuerpo (Figuras 2 y 3) la zona inferior de la boca suele ser de color amarillo y el vientre de color crema uniforme. Los machos pueden medir hasta 160 cm y las hembras hasta 250 cm (Campbell y Lamar, 1989). Los juveniles machos tienen una coloración amarilla ó blanca en la punta de la cola (los últimos 10 a 20 mm). Una vez adultos, no hay una diferencia física externa que diferencie el macho de la hembra a excepción de un ensanchamiento en la base de la cola a la altura de la cloaca en los machos, debido a la presencia de los hemipenes. La cabeza es grande y se diferencia del cuello. El ojo es mediano y tiene una pupila elíptica. Tiene de 7 a 8 escamas supralabiales, de 8 a 12 escamas infralabiales, 1 escama loreal, 3 escamas preoculares, 2 a 4 escamas postoculares, 23 a 33 filas de escamas dorsales a medio cuerpo, escamas ventrales en machos 161-216, en hembras 187-240, Escamas subcaudales en machos 57-81, en hembras 46-70, una placa anal única. Tiene una raya oscura desde la parte postocular hasta el ángulo de la boca. El cuerpo tiene una forma ligeramente triangular. Las escamas dorsales son fuertemente guilladas, por eso el nombre específico es asper, la palabra en latín para áspero. Los termo-receptores se encuentran a la misma distancia de los ojos y la fosa nasal y está en contacto con la segunda escama supralabial, la escama mental es ligeramente más larga que ancha, la escama rostral presenta forma hexagonal, las escamas geneiales se presentan en disposición 2+2.” (Folleco-Fernández 2010).<br>

Bothrops sanctaecrucis occurs in sympatry with B. atrox in Beni and B. moojeni occurs with B. atrox in eastern Santa Cruz. Although not yet collected in Bolivia, B. brazili almost certainly occurs with B. atrox in La Paz and Pando. Of the four, B. atrox is the most easily recognized. Unlike the other species, Bolivian B. atrox have well-defined, high, dark  <span style="color: green;">brown</span>  <span style="color: red;">postocular stripes</span>  When present, the  <span style="color: red;">postocular stripes</span>  of the other species are one scale high (vs. <span style="color: green;">2–2.5 scales high</span>  in B. atrox). The  <span style="color: red;">venter</span>  of B. atrox is rather heavily pigmented and consists of staggered cream and gray to black (=melanophores) squares (lowland populations) or is  <span style="color: green;">uniformly and heavily speckled</span> (specimens from the Andean slopes in La Paz). The  <span style="color: red;">venter</span>  of Bothrops brazili is also moderately to heavily pigmented, but the other  <span style="color: green;">two</span>  species have cream venters with only a very diffuse pattern not consisting of staggered squares. Bothrops brazili and B. sanctaecrucis may further be distinguished from B. atrox and B. moojeni by fewer than four (2–4 in B. brazili, 0–3 in B. sanctaecrucis) <span style="color: red;">keeled scales</span>  between the  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">canthals</span> </span> (vs. <span style="color: green;">2–7</span>  in B. atrox and B. moojeni). In addition, B. sanctaecrucis has a pale green iris (pinkish copper to bronze in the other species) and Bolivian B. moojeni have curving stripes on their necks.In neonates and juveniles of these four species, the  <span style="color: red;">caudal</span>  oneto  <span style="color: green;">two</span> -thirds of the tail is  <span style="color: green;">yellow</span>  The tip of the tail darkens with age, but it is most  <span style="color: green;">distinct</span>  in adult Bothrops sanctaecrucis where the  <span style="color: red;">distal tail</span>  is  <span style="color: green;">black dorsally and ventrally</span>  sharply contrasting with the base of the tail. In the other species, the dorsal surface of the tail is about the same color as the dorsal blotches and does not sharply contrast with the dorsal pattern. Table 2 summarizes distinguishing characteristics of these similar species (Harvey 2005: 16).<br>

These markings may be either opposite each other or partially to completely juxta­ posed| most individuals have all three variations. The  <span style="color: red;">pale borders</span>  of the brown markings are usually  <span style="color: green;">diffuse</span>  but broad, and the dorsal markings are heavily invaded basally by the paler ground color. The configuration of each dorsal marking is subject to considerable, and often extreme, variation, with elon­ gations, fusions, and fragmentations occurring. In some speci­ mens the  <span style="color: red;">middorsal region</span>  is  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">unmarked</span> </span>  and the  <span style="color: red;">dorsal pattern</span>  is reduced to a pair of  <span style="color: green;">undulating</span>  <span style="color: red;">dorsolateral stripes</span>  The inter­ spaces tend to have  <span style="color: green;">irregular</span>  <span style="color: green;">diffuse</span>  mottling, especially on the posterior third of the body. In many specimens the basal inva­ sions of ground color into the dorsal blotches may have distinct shapes with well-defined edges, creating a C-shaped mark resembling the outline of a headphone. The overall pattern becomes more concentrated on the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  usually appearing as  <span style="color: green;">irregular</span>  pale gray markings on a  <span style="color: green;">dark ground color</span>  The  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">venter</span> </span>  is  <span style="color: green;">pale greenish to yellowish white</span>  with  <span style="color: green;">irregular</span>  <span style="color: red;">blotching</span>  or a powdering of gray pigment| alternatively, it may be uniformly gray. The tip of the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  of juveniles is white.Machado (1945c) and Lema (1960c) described color variants in which the middorsum was almost uniformly brown and the lateral dark blotches were drawn out into a broad, broken stripe.There are  <span style="color: green;">5-12</span>  weakly keeled  <span style="color: red;">intersupraoculars</span> | <span style="color: green;">7-9</span>  <span style="color: red;">supra</span> ­ labials (usually 8| one record each for 6 and 10), the second fused with the prelacunal| 9-13 infralabiais (usually 10-12)| 20-27 (usually 23-25) midbody dorsal scale rows| 170-216 (rarely as many as 218) ventrals| and 51-71 (single records for 35 and 44 doubtful) mostly divided subcaudals.” (Campbell & Lamar 2004: 391)Comparisons: “Five species of lanceheads at least partially sympatric with B. jararaca share a similar pattern and have the second supralabial fused with the prelacunal to form a lacuno-labial.

Bothrops neuwiedi	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis (genus): Bothropoides differ from other South American pitvipers in 38 mitochondrial characters (Table 4 in FENWICK et al. 2009). External characters overlap with other South American genera, with no unique synapomorphies in scalation. Distribution in eastern South America, combined with terrestrial habitat in grasslands or broad-leaf forests (Bothropoides neuwiedi group), or semiarboreal habitat in Atlantic forests (B. jararaca group), distinguishes this genus from others (see Table 4). Bothropoides has fewer interrictals (21– 34) than the other South American genera (24–40), and some individuals have high numbers of  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span> ( <span style="color: green;">7–11</span>  also seen in Rhinocerophis| all other South American genera have 7 or 8  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span> ). Bothropoides differs from Bothrops and Bothriopsis in having most species with the  <span style="color: red;">prelacunal</span>  <span style="color: green;">separate</span>  from the second supralabial (B. jararaca, B. alcatraz, and B. insularis have the  <span style="color: red;">prelacunal</span>  fused to the second supralabial). Some specimens have both  <span style="color: green;">divided and entire</span>  <span style="color: red;">subcaudals</span>  a state also seen in Bothriopsis. Bothropoides differs from Bothriopsis in the lack of a prehensile tail and  <span style="color: green;">lack of green</span>  <span style="color: red;">coloration</span>  It differs from Bothrocophias in the  <span style="color: green;">lack of white spots</span>  on the  <span style="color: red;">gular scales</span>  and the  <span style="color: green;">lack of tuberculate keels</span>  on  <span style="color: red;">posterior dorsal scales</span>  Bothropoides differs from some Rhinocerophis (R. alternatus, R. cotiara, R. fonsecai, and R. jonathani) in the absence of distinctive back bars on the underside of the  <span style="color: red;">head</span> (FENWICK et al. 2009).Diagnosis (species): More than half or all the  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span>  of intense dark pigmentation with large round white spots.

Cerrophidion godmani	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis (genus): see Campbell & Lamar 1992: 24.Definition and diagnosis: Rostral wider than high, front surface flat| three preoculars, upper largest, entire, and squarish, lower forming posterior border of pit and excluded from orbit| single, large, flat, plate-like supraocular above eye| seven to 11 supralabials| eight to 12 infralabials| canthals and internasals relatively large and flat| two to seven intersupraoculars| crown of head covered with variably sized, flat or keeled scales| keeling prominent in parietal area| second supralabial discrete from prelacunal| supralabial and subocular series in contact or separated by single row of scales| 19–23 (mode 21) middorsal dorsal scale rows| mid-dorsal scales at midbody moderately slender and pointed| 120–150 ventrals| 22–36 undivided subcaudals| tail spine straight, moderately long. Lateral edge of nasal broadly expanded, bone roughly quadrangular| frontal bones mostly flat, dorsal surface with slightly elevated margins, longer than wide| postfrontal large, not reaching frontal| transverse distance of postfrontal greater than its distance along parietal bone| posterolateral edges of dorsal surface of parietals forming low to moderately distinct raised ridge continuing posteriorly on parietal as low ridge| junction between parietal and prootic rounded to almost flat| squamosal extending to level posterior to posterior edge of exoccipital| ectopterygoid about same length as expanded, flattened base of pterygoid (posterior to the articulation with ectopterygoid) with flat shaft gradually tapering posteriorly| dorsal surface of parietal roughly triangular to sometimes rounded| three to five palatine teeth| seven to 18 pterygoid teeth| eight to 16 dentary teeth| pterygoid teeth extending just posterior to level of articulation of pterygoid with ectopterygoid in C. godmani, but not reaching this far back in congeners| maxillary fang relatively short, being about equal in length to height of maxilla| fang at rest extending to level of about middle of supralabial 5 or suture between supralabials 5–6 (after Campbell & Lamar, 2004 and JADIN et al. 2011).Diagnosis: Similar to other Cerrophidion species, C. godmani s.s. is a medium-sized, blotched, terrestrial pitviper. The head is relatively long, the canthal ridge is distinct and raised and two canthals are usually present. There are 3–7 scales (two in one specimen) across the top of the head between the supraoculars. The scales in the frontal region between supraoculars vary from being a single median scale to small, keeled scales approximately of the same size. The population in southeastern Oaxaca is characterized by having a large median frontal scale occupying more than two-thirds of the distance between the supraoculars| in all other populations individuals have median frontals that are undifferentiated from adjacent scales or that occupy less than half the distance between supraoculars. The supraoculars are broad and the nasal is divided. There are 2–5 prefoveals, a single prelacunal, no lacunolabials, a single loreal, 0–2 subfoveals, 3 preoculars, 8–11 supralabials (usually 9), 9–13 infralabials (usually 10 or 11), 132–150 ventrals (x = 140.57), 22–36 (x = 28.69) undivided subcaudals with no significant sexual dimorphism, and usually 21 middorsal scale rows. The cloacal scute is undivided. The tail is relatively short and non-prehensile [JADIN et al. 2012].Original description: Günther 1863: 364<br>

Groundcolor above dull  <span style="color: green;">yellowish brown</span>  with a series of  <span style="color: red;">subhexagonal patches</span>  <span style="color: green;">from the head nearly to the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span> </span>  in an uninterrupted series, separated throughout by narrow lines. We may refer the markings to the intersection of two series of light  <span style="color: red;">yellowish lines</span>  about  <span style="color: green;">40 in number</span>  crossing obliquely from each side across to the other, along the anterior half of as many  <span style="color: red;">oblique series of scales</span>  The  <span style="color: red;">lateral decussation</span>  is  <span style="color: green;">along the sixth row of dorsal scales</span> | on the back, where they cross, the lines are confluent for breadth of five or six scales, a making a series of transverse lines across the back, truncating the obtuse angles of the rhomboids, which would otherwise be produced. Sometimes the acute lateral angle of the rhomboids are also truncated. Laterally, the  <span style="color: red;">yellowish lines</span>  are more or less obsolete, leaving a more or less distinct chain pattern. The rhomboids or subrhomboids enclosed have a narrow margin of dark brown, lighter toward the centre. In all cases the interval between the successive rhomboids is but one or two half scales in width. The lateral rhomboids and triangles referred to in C. adamanteus are indicated by two alternating series of dark brown blotches, the first along the 3d and 4th lateral row, opposite the apices of the rhomboids| the second along the 6th and 7th, and alternating with the same| the spots occupy one scale, or part of four contiguous ones. Space between these rhomboids and the  <span style="color: red;">yellowish lines</span>  dull  <span style="color: green;">yellowish brown</span>  Beneath nearly uniform yellowish, slightly clouded on the sides of the scales. On the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  the blotches are confluent into 3 or 6 dark brown half rings, interrupted on the under surface. General distribution of lines on the head much as in C. adamanteus| a narrow light line from the posterior end of the  <span style="color: green;">superciliary</span>  backward, directly to the angle of the mouth| a second from the anterior extremity, nearly parallel with the first, the two enclosing an indistinct patch, and separated on the  <span style="color: red;">labials</span>  by 4} scales. There is also a single narrow light line across the  <span style="color: green;">superciliary</span>  perpendicular to its length, obsolete in old specimens. It may readily be distinguished from C. adamanteus by its light  <span style="color: red;">color</span>  and the truncations of the rhomboids, as well as the general obsoleteness of the lateral markings. The rhomboids are longer in proportion and more rounded. The two lateral rows of scales are smooth, the next two more strongly carinated than in C. adamanteus. The 5th upper labial is largest, and transverse the rest nearly uniform. The stripes on the side of the head are less distinct. From C. confluentus, it may be distinguished by the greater comparative size of the interval between the dorsal blotches, especially posteriorly. In C. confluentus, there are two light lines across the  <span style="color: green;">superciliary</span>  plate, dividing it into three sections, the central rather narrower. Here, too, the posterior facial stripe, instead of passing to the angle of the mouth, goes back of it on the 2d row above the  <span style="color: red;">labials</span>  in C. atrox, passing directly to the angle of the mouth. Other important distinctions are seen in the narrower scales of C. con fluentus, &c. From C. lucifer, the more narrow head, fewer and larger intersuperciliary scales, lighter  <span style="color: red;">color</span>  arrangement of  <span style="color: red;">color</span>  along the head, will at once distinguish it.” (Baird & Girard 1853: 5)<br>

Crotalus lepidus	Serpentes	Viperidae	Description: “C. lepidus (TBL to 83 cm) is gray, greenish, pink, or tan with a pattern of 13-31 narrow, dark brown or black, irregularly spaced dorsal bands and 2-3 (1-6) similar bands on the tail. The bands are often bordered by paler pigments (particularly those anterior), and small spots or irregular gray mottling may occur between the bands. A pinkish brown stripe runs backward from under the eye to the corner of the mouth. The venter is pink to light tan anteriorly, but more gray toward the tail. Dorsal body scales are keeled, and usually either in 23 or 25 (21-26) anterior rows, 23 (20-26) midbody rows, and 17-18 (14-20) rows near the tail. Beneath are 147-173 ventrals, 16-33 subcaudals, and an undivided anal plate. Dorsal head scalation consists of a rostral (usually wider than long), 2 internasals that touch medially, 5-15 scales in the internasal-prefrontal area (a canthal is usually present on each side, but prefrontals are absent), 2 supraoculars, and 2 (1-4) intersupraoculars. Laterally are 2 nasals (the prenasal touches a supralabial, but the postnasal does not contact the upper preocular), 1 (2) loreal(s), 3 (0-7) prefoveals (a series of small scales anterior to the preoculars), 2 (3-4) preoculars, 2 (1-5) postoculars, 3 (2-5) suboculars, 12-13 (10-15) supralabials, and 11-12 (9-13) infralabials. The short, bifurcate hemipenis has a divided sulcus spermaticus, about 33 spines and 19 fringes per lobe, but no spines in the crotch between the lobes. Males have 147-172 (mean, 160.6) ventrals, 20-33 (mean, 25) subcaudals, and TLs 6.9-10.4 (mean, 8.5) % of TBL| females have 149-173 (mean, 161.2) ventrals, 16-24 (mean, 20) subcaudals, and TLs 5.4-8.5 (mean, 7.0) % of TBL. Adult males are longer than adult females. (Ernst & Ernst 2003: 509)GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION. Four subspecies are recognized, but only two occur in the United States. C. 1. lepidus (Kennicott 1861), the mottled rock rattlesnake, has a dark gray or brown stripe extending backward from the orbit to the corner of the mouth, no dark blotches on the nape of the neck, a mottled dorsal body pattern with the crossbands faded and only slightly distinct from the pale ground color, and a relatively dark venter. It is found from southwestern Texas (except the El Paso area) and southeastern New Mexico southward in Mexico to San Luis Potosí. C. I. klauberi Gloyd 1936, the banded rock rattlesnake, often lacks a dark stripe from the orbit to the corner of mouth, has two dark blotches on the nape of the neck, a darker ground color crossed by well-defined dark bands with little mottling between, and light-colored venter. This subspecies is sexually dichromatic: males are greenish and females gray (Jacob and Altenbach 1977). This difference may have evolved for background matching through natural selection influenced by predation pressure, and is a result of a sexlinked gene that either balances the percent of color morphs in the population or functions in sex recognition. It occurs from extreme western Texas, south-western New Mexico and southeastern Arizona southwestward to northern Jalisco, Mexico. Much variation in body coloration and pattern occurs between populations. Ground color of C. l. lepidus is set at birth, and seems to be an adaptation to the dominant substrate color of its habitat (Campbell and Lamar 1989| Vincent 1982a, 1982b| after Ernst & Ernst 2003).Diagnosis (klauberi): Distinguished from Crotalzcs lepidus lepidus by the absence of a dark stripe from the orbit to the angle of the mouth| a more vivid coloration, the pattern of dark brown or black crossbands contrasting strongly with the glaucous or greenish gray ground color, and equally distinct throughout the length| the absence of dark blotches between the crossbands or their restriction to small spots on a very few scales| and the light coloration of the belly.” (GLOYD 1936)Diagnosis (maculosus): A medium to small subspecies of lepidus differing from other subspecies in having a dorsal series of small spots often longer than wide and in a primary series averaging 29-31 spots. It also differs from other subspecies in that the dorsal spots do not extend laterally on each side of the body to form cross bars, except near the tail where the spots may form moderate cross bars (Fig. 1). C. l. maculosus differs from klauberi and lepidus in having an increase in the average number of ventrals and caudals, and from klauberi in that the ground color is heavily pigmented between the spots, a character shared with lepidus and morulus. It is further distinguished from klauberi by the heavy flecking on the ventrals, reduced number of scales between the supraoccipitals, presence of a postocular stripe, reduction in number of scales in internasal-prefrontal area, and by its smaller size. Crotalus l. maculosus shares with lepidus and morulus the dark ground color, postocular stripe and with morulus an increase in body spots, ventrals and caudals and paired occipital blotches. It is most distinct from morulus in that the upper preocular is divided and the anterior subocular is usually in contact with the upper labials. (Tanner et al. 1972)DESCRIPTION OF TYPE (maculosus).

A brown patch below and behind the eye.One of the most strongly marked of all the species.

Anterior nasal subtriangular. Top of head with numerous smooth subtuberculous scales. Suborbitals large, extending to the anterior canthus. General aspect smoother than in Crotali generally, scales rounded at the posterior apex, carinated but slightly.Coloration: General color above that of roll sulphur, beneath pale yellowish, posteriorly very faintly clouded with brownish. <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  black. Anteriorly the scutella are entirely immaculate. Along the back is a series of transverse reddish or chestnut-brown lozenges embraced in a width of 12 or 14 scales and 4 or 5 scales long, and with the exterior angles produced to the abdomen. These lozenges are frames with the outline generally one scale in width and with the centres of the ground-color| sometimes divided by a median line of brown, so as to show two yellowish spots inside of the lozenges. The scales exterior to the lozenges are rather lighter. Sometimes the brown rings and the lozenges widen at the abdomen and indicate lateral spots of four scales| at others, and especially anteriorly, the rings are obsolete, and the brown is in a dorsal series. In fact, for the anterior fourth of the body we have a dorsal patch of brown, showing alternately at successive intervals one large yellowish spot and then a pair of smaller ones, owing to the confluence of the successive lozenges. 'The superciliaries and scales anterior to them, as well as a  <span style="color: green;">broad</span>  patch below and behind the eye, light greenish brown. <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  uniform dark brown above, paler beneath. Only one button with two necks, no rattle. A remarkable character of this species is that each individual scale is of the same uniform tint to its base, and not showing two colours as in other species.” (Baird & Girard 1853: 10)<br>

Differs from C. s. salvini in the following characteristics: row of pale, unicolored scales bordering dorsal body blotches| dark postorbital stripe extending to angle of mouth or beyond| distal dark tail bands black, in contrast to posterior body blotches| upper part of proximal lobe of rattle matrix black (except in juveniles). (Price 1982)DIAGNOSIS (salvini). Differs from C. s. scutulatus in the following characteristics: dorsal body blotches without pale borders| dark postorbital stripe not extending as far as angle of mouth| distal dark tail bands not black, not in contrast to posterior body blotches| upper part of proximal lobe of rattle matrix only slightly, if at all, darkened.

It differs in being light brown instead of greenish gray, and in having shorter transverse dorsal bars, which are much lighter than the ground  <span style="color: red;">color</span>  instead of black cross bars, which are so characteristic of C. lepidus.” (Meek 1905)Description (obscurus): “A Crotalus willardi lacking all prominent white flashmarks on the head. Vestigial light areas may be present, especially along the last supraoculars, but are not the characteristic white flashmarks associated with the other subspecies. The low dorsal scale count at midbody (mode 25) and high number of subcaudals (average 30.1 in males, 25.9 in females) and light grey or brownish dorsal coloration are characteristic of this subspecies. The lack of white flashmarks on the head , the abundant melanophore fine-stippling on the surfaces of the head , and the light grey or light brownish ground  <span style="color: red;">color</span>  immediately set C. w. obscurus apart from the other known subspecies of C. willardi.” (HARRIS & SIMMONS 1974)<br>

The results of PCA indicate that significant differences in head morphology exist between G. s. qianshanensis, G. s. shedaoensis, G. intermedius, and G. changdaoensis (Fig. 6). HL and PSW are the main indexes to distinguish the above species in PCA (Table 3).

On the back are  <span style="color: green;">2 offset series</span>  of  <span style="color: red;">transverse markings</span>  that are sometimes attached to form an undulating bar, or on the contrary are joined in pairs to form well-spaced rectangular, transverse bars. These markings can be very faded, even totally absent (especially in M . I. obtusa and the red form of M . I. schweizeri). These markings are often browner, even redder, than the ground colour| they can have dark or pale borders. There is a series of dark vertical bars on the flanks thatalternate with the back markings. The body is sometimes dotted withminuscule ochre or yellowish spots. There is no pattern on the top of the  <span style="color: red;">head</span> | <span style="color: red;">head</span>  side often darker than the top| there is an often faded vertical dark mark under the eye and an only slightly contrasting dark temporal band from the eye to corner of the mouth. The belly is pale grey, whitish or grey-brown with much dark grey or blackish mottling.” (Geniez 2018)Diagnosis (schweizeri): Werner 1935 diagnoses this subspecies from bornmülleri, xanthina, lebeina (s.str.) and mauritanica by these traits: “Schuppen in 21 — 23 Reihen, unterste Temporalenreihen ungekielt, Supraoculare in kleine Schildchen aufgelöst| Subcaudalia Männchen 40—45, Weibchen 33—41”Diagnosis (transmediterranea): A subspecies of Vipera lebetina that is geographically separated from other subspecies by the Mediterranean Sea, and which can be characterized as a typical lebetina form having light ground colour with a pattern consisting of 34-41 transverse bars. Midbody scale rows 25 in number and the number of ventrals is between 150 and 164 in females| between 154 and 163 in males.This new subspecies differs from other taxa of the lebetina complex s. l. (except for V. lebetina and V. schweizeri, Table 1), in having a low ventral number. The mean values for different scalation characteristics indicate a higher fragmentation of  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  scales in this new taxon compared with other subspecies of lebetina as weil as withV. schweizeri and V. mauritanica (see Table 2). The mean value for the number of loreals, interoculars and 1st and 2nd circumoculars is higher than in any of the compared taxa. lt is most similar to the nominate subspecies, Vipera l. lebetina from Cyprus, from which, however, it differs in having a higher ventral count (150 to 164 in female, and 154 to 163 in male transmediterranea| 146 to 153 in female, and 147 to 154 in male l. lebetina), and in the number of anterior scale rows which range from 23 to 27 (X = 24) in transmediterranea and from 21 to 23 (X = 22.2) in l. lebetina. From the sympatric (or parapatric) Vipera mauritanica the new subspecies differs in colour pattern (V. mauritanica has a wavy zig-zag band containing 23 to 33 windings| V. l. transmediterranea has 34 to 41 transverse bands), the midbody scale rows are 25 in V. l. transmediterranea, 27 in V. mauritanica| the number of scale rows on the neck is around 24 in V. l. transmediterranea,between 26 and 27 in V. mauritanica| the number of ventrals is 150 to 164 in female and 154 to 163 in male V. l. transmediterranea,157 to 174 in female and 163 to 170 in male V.mauritanica| the number of subcaudals is between 37 and 43 in female V. l. transmediterranea, and between 45 and 48 in female V. mauritanica| corresponding figures for males are between 42 to 51 and 45 to 50 respectively.Size: Maximum  <span style="color: red;">length</span>  for both sexes is 98.5 cm.

The loreal is wider than high. The upper preocular is large, extending dorsally over the cantal ridge. The middle preocular is divided or not, infrequently absent, in contact with the orbit or not. The lower preocular is single, infrequently absent, in contact with the orbit or not. The anal plate is single. The tail is not prehensile. Apical pits are absent. •The hemipenis is divided with a bifurcate sulcus spermaticus, the sulcus dividing close to the base of the organ and each branch extending to the distal end of the apical lobe. The basal portion of the organ and the areas lateral to and between the branches of the sulcus are spinulate. The shoulders and the absulcate side of the organ are covered with spines which increase gradually in size proximally, terminating with a pair of enlarged basal spines situated on either side of the sulcus. Distal areas of the apical lobes are calculate with papillate microornamentation" (Porras et al., 1981).

Porthidium ophryomegas	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis/Similar Species. “Porthidium ophryomegas can be distinguished from all other Honduran snakes, except fellow viperids, a by having a thermosensitive pit located between the eye and nostril. Agkistrodon bilineatus has 9-15 enlarged plates on top of the head (versus many small scales on top of head in P. ophryomegas). Atropoides indomitus and A. mexicanus have extremely narrow supraoculars or the supraoculars broken into small scales and usually 4-5 scale rows between the chinshields and first preventral (versus single, large supraocular scale on each side and  <span style="color: green;">2-3</span>  scale rows between chinshields and first preventral in P. ophryomegas). The species of Bothriechis have prehensile tails (versus non-prehensile tail in P. ophryomegas). In addition, B. marchi and B. thalassinus have green dorsal surfaces in life in adults and B. schlegelii has enlarged superciliary scales forming "eyebrows" (versus brown to black dorsal surfaces with darker blotches and no enlarged superciliary scales in P. ophryomegas). Bothrops asper has mostly  <span style="color: green;">paired</span>  subcaudals that usually number more than 50 (versus single subcaudal scales that number fewer than 50 in P. ophryomegas). Cerrophidion godmani has 21  <span style="color: red;">dorsal scale rows</span>  at midbody, fewer than 150  <span style="color: red;">ventrals</span>  and usually 4-5  <span style="color: red;">rows of scales</span>  separating the chinshields from the first preventral (versus  <span style="color: green;">23-27</span>  <span style="color: red;">dorsal scale rows</span>  at midbody, <span style="color: green;">more than 150</span>  <span style="color: red;">ventrals</span>  and  <span style="color: green;">2-3</span>  <span style="color: red;">rows of scales</span>  separating chinshields from first preventral in P. ophryomegas). Crotalus simus has a rattle or button on the end of the tail (versus no rattle or button in P. ophryomegas). Porthidium nasutum has fewer than 150  <span style="color: red;">ventrals</span>  one  <span style="color: red;">canthal scale</span>  on each  <span style="color: red;">side of the head</span>  and a dorsal extension on the tip of the snout (versus  <span style="color: green;">more than 150</span>  <span style="color: red;">ventrals</span>  <span style="color: green;">paired</span>  canthals on each side, and no dorsal extension on tip of snout in P. ophryomegas).” (McCranie 2011: 518)<br>

Sistrurus miliarius	Serpentes	Viperidae	RECOGNITION. S. miliarius is small (maximum TBL 83.2 cm, but typically 40-55 cm) with nine enlarged scales on the dorsal surface of the head (see also S. catenatus), a series of 22-45 (mean, 33) dark dorsal body blotches, one to three rows of dark spots on its sides, and a red to orange vertebral stripe. The body is normally gray or tan, but reddish orange to brick red individuals occur along the northeastern edge of the range, chiefly in Beaufort and Hyde counties, North Carolina. The venter is whitish to cream-colored with a moderate to heavy pattern of dark blotches. A black or reddish brown bar extends backward from the eye to beyond the corner of the mouth, and two dark longitudinal, often wavy, stripes are present on the back of the head. Dorsal body scales have keels, and occur in 23-25 anterior rows, 21-23 (19-25) midbody rows, and 17 (15-19) rows near the vent. The venter has 122-148 ventral scutes, 25-39 subcaudals, and an undivided anal plate. On the side of the head are 2 nasals, a loreal (lying between the postnasal and upper preocular), 2 preoculars, 3-4 (5-6) postoculars, 4-5 rows of temporals, 10-11 (8-13) supralabials, and 11-12 (9-14) infralabials. The hemipenis is similar to that of S. catenatus. Males are usually smaller, and have longer tails, which are thicker at the base (Bishop et al. 1996). They also have 122-148 (mean, 130) ventrals, 28-39 (mean, 34) subcaudals, 7-14 (mean, 11) dark tail bands, and TLs 10-15 (mean, 12.5) % of TBL| females have 123-148 (mean, 135) ventrals, 25-36 (mean, 30) subcaudals, 6-13 (mean, 9) dark tail bands, and TLs 9-12 (mean, 10.5) % of TBL. (Ernst & Ernst 2003: 557) Description (miliarius): S. m. miliarius (Linneaus 1766), the Carolina pigmy rattlesnake, is gray to reddish brown with a well-marked head pattern, one to two rows of lateral spots, usually 25 anterior and 23 midbody scale rows, and dark ventral spots at least two scutes wide. (Ernst & Ernst 2003: 557)DIAGNOSIS (barbouri). The most striking characteristic of this form is its generally dark coloration which alone is usually sufficient to separate it from either of the other 2 subspecies. Other distinctive characters are the obscure head pattern, 3 rows of dark blotches on each side of the main series, and the white ventral surface heavily blotched or distinctly spotted with black or very dark brown. It also has a higher average number of ventrals (5 to 10) than either of the others, and differs further from the western form in having the scale row formula 25-23-17 instead of 23-21-17. (Gloyd 1935: 2)DESCRIPTION OF TYPE (barbouri). Top of head flat, covered by 9 shields: 2 internasals, 2 prefrontals, frontal, 2 supraoculars, and 2 parietals which are recurved at the postero-lateral borders. The rostral is higher than wide, truncate at the top. The 2 preoculars, the lower of which is divided vertically, are separated from the postnasal on each side by a single high loreal which is in broad contact above with the prefrontal. The lower edge of the loreal forms the antero-dorsal border of the maxillary pit. There are 4 postoculars and 1 large anterior subocular on each side. The supralabials are 10 on each side, the third and fourth separated from the orbit by 1 scale, the anterior subocular. The scales of the lowest row of temporals are smooth, those of the upper rows keeled. There are 10 infralabials on each side, the first pair meeting in a long median contact behind the mental. One pair of chin shields, about 1.5 times as long as broad, followed by 4 pairs of median gular scales. The first ventral scute is separated from the posterior infralabials by rows of lateral gulars. Dorsal scale rows 25 a short distance back of the head, 23 at mid-body, and 17 just anterior to the tail| all rows are keeled at mid-body. Ventrals 143, caudals 36, the distal 4 divided. Anal plate not divided. (Gloyd 1935: 2)Size (barbouri): Total length 493 mm.| length of tail 63 mm. The rattle is composed of an incomplete set of four segments about equal in size. (Gloyd 1935: 2) Coloration (barbouri): Dorsal ground color brownish gray, densely stippled with brownish black. Top of head, rostral, nasals, loreals and preoculars brownish black. Upper labials almost all black| mental and lower labials white blotched with black. A blackish brown, light-edged stripe about 3 scales wide extends from the eye to the back of the head, 3 scales posterior to the angle of the mouth. A pair of elongate black blotches in the occipital region. A mid-dorsal series of 34 subovate black blotches from neck to base of tail. Anteriorly the individual blotches are narrowly outlined with white| posteriorly the edges are indistinct. Three lateral series of grayish black blotches on each side. The spots of the uppermost lateral series are less distinct and alternate with those of the mid-dorsal row| some of them extend across the midline as faint crossbands. The spots of the midlateral row are more conspicuous and are opposite those of the mid-dorsal series. The blotches of the lowest lateral row alternate with those immediately above and lie partly on the edges of the ventral scutes. The mid-dorsal stripe of reddish brown, which is conspicuous in some individuals of this species, is represented in the type specimen by a few bright brown scales between the occipital blotches and between the spots of the neck and anterior portion of the body. The dorsal pattern of the tail consists of 9 brownish black blotches broadening into crossbands and becoming lighter in color posteriorly. Ventral ground color of body and tail cream, heavily blotched and stippled with deep brownish black. Paratypes Nos. 12509 and 12511 are similar to the type in coloration, but a few of the anterior blotches of the mid-dorsal series are divided medianly, the halves alternating with one another. No. 12510 is more intensely colored and is a particularly handsome specimen. The ground color of dark grayish brown is densely stippled with dark gray. The mid-dorsal reddish brown stripe is very conspicuous between the brownish black spots of the dorsal series. The dark blotches of the main series are narrowly outlined with white and toward the posterior part of the body expand laterally, connecting with the spots of the mid-lateral series to form crossbands. The ventral surface is white with large, distinct spots of deep brownish black. (Gloyd 1935: 2)DIAGNOSIS (streckeri). The smaller number of anterior scale rows, 23-21-17, will separate most specimens of this subspecies from miliarius and barbouri each of which normally has 25-23-17. The pattern is distinet and very irregular: the blotches of the mid-dorsal series are conspicuously wider than long| there are but 1 or 2 series of spots on the sides, those of the midlateral series are usually higher than wide| the dark pigment of the ventral surface is diffuse, and the ventral blotches are usually not wider than 1 scute. The average number of ventrals is lowest in this form. (Gloyd 1935: 2)DESCRIPTION OF TYPE (streckeri). Crown covered by 9 plates, arranged symmetrically: a pair of internasals, a pair of prefrontals, a single 5-sided frontal, a pair of supraoculars, and a pair of parietals. Rostral higher than wide, apex truncate. Canthus rostralis distinet| edges of prefrontals, frontal, and parietals recurved. Nasals 2 on each side with nostril in suture between, anterior larger. Preoculars 2, the lower divided by a median vertical suture. Loreals 1 on each side, each almost as high as postnasal, in contact with prefrontal, and completely separating postnasal from preocular. Orbit separated from third and fourth supralabials by 1 large anterior subocular, and from the fourth and fifth supralabials by 2 scales the upper of which is very small. Postoculars 5 one each side. Supralabials 11 on the left side, 10 on the right. Infralabials 11 on each side. Temporals keeled, except those of the lowest row. First pair of infralabials in broad contact at the mid-line immediately posterior to the tip of the mental. One pair of chin shields, each about twice as long as wide. Four transverse rows of median gulars| first ventral scute separated from posterior infralabials by 5 rows of lateral gulars. Dorsal scale rows 23-21-18, all strongly carinate except those of the lowest row of each side on which the keels are faint. Ventral scutes 126| anal plate not divided| subcaudal scales 33, the last 2 divided. (Gloyd 1935: 2)Size (streckeri): Total length 535 mm.| length of tail 68 mm. Rattle incomplete, consisting of 3 segments. (Gloyd 1935: 2)Coloration (streckeri): Dorsal ground color of fresh specimen in alcohol pale grayish brown, lightly stippled and flecked with brown. Top of head with irregular brown blotches on internasals and prefrontals, a wide transverse bar of pale brown on frontal and supraoculars, and a pair of undulating stripes extending backward from the posterior edges of the supraoculars to the neck. An indistinct vertical brown streak in the middle of the nostril| a brown spot on the nasal scales above nostril. A conspicuous cheek stripe of dark brown extends from the orbit to the angle of the jaw, and beneath this is a white line from below the orbit to the last supralabial. Supralabials stippled with brown, more densely posteriorly. Mental, infralabials, chin shields, and gulars cream, irregularly stippled, flecked, and blotched with. brown. The body pattern consists of a median dorsal series of dark brown blotches, about 30 in number, some divided and alternating, and 2 lateral series of brown blotches, the lowest of which is less distinct and lies partly on the ventral surface. The blotches of the dorsal series are conspicuously wider than long, with irregular margins, and narrowly outlined with white. An indistinct mid-dorsal stripe of reddish brown, on the scales of the median row and portions of the adjacent rows, extends from the occipital region to the base of the tail. The blotches of the upper lateral series are opposite those of the dorsal series, noticeably higher than wide, and irregularly outlined with white. There are 11 irregular transverse brown bands on the tail. Ventral surface cream, irregularly blotched laterally with grayish brown. The blotches are variable in size and sharpness, and in the main each is confined to a single ventral scute. (Gloyd 1935: 2)<br>

Chin, throat and infralabials uniform bluish green, with some faint darker spots posteriorly. The body is bluish-green on the lower part of the sides, i.e. on 1st–4th DSR, becoming quickly darker, dark greyish- or greenish-blue above 4th DSR, but this colour turns into pale brown or bluish-brown on the two anterior thirds of the body| on each side, a series of irregularly rounded, cream blotches on 5th–6th DSR, visible only on the posterior half of the body, more or less widely separated each from the other by 5 to 18 scale rows| a cream, conspicuous ventrolateral stripe covering much of 1st DSR and the lower half of 2nd DSR, extending from neck up to vent. The tail is dark greyish blue on its immediate anterior part then covered with four wide and broad, cream blotches covering both the sides and the upper part of the tail| the ventrolateral stripe of the body extends for a short length on the lower sides of tail| posteriorly, the tail is entirely cream. The venter is uniform pale bluish green| subcaudals not edged with a darker hue| the tail is uniform pale bluish green on its anterior part then quickly turns to cream.” (Vogel et al. 2022)Species description and variation. According to Brongersma (1933a), Tweedie (1983), Sanders et al. (2002), Gumprecht et al. (2003, 2004) and our material, this large species reaches a maximum total length of 1,230 mm. Gumprecht et al. (2003) mentioned a total length of 1,400 mm but we could not find such a large specimen. Males are seemingly shorter, the longest male seen by us being only 956 mm long. Adults usually reach a maximum total length of 750–1,050 mm. Rostral barely visible from above, triangular, about as high as broad| nasals subrectangular or pentagonal, entire or with traces of a shallow furrow| 1 large internasal on each side, subrectangular or trapezium-like, laterally elongate, 1.2–1.5 times wider than long| internasals usually in contact (in 65/72 examined specimens) or separated by 1 small scale (7/72)| internasals followed by upper snout scales, irregular, distinctly enlarged, smooth, juxtaposed or barely imbricate, subrectangular, with 4–5 scales along a longitudinal line extending from the internasals to a line connecting the anterior margins of the eyes| 2 (rarely 3) canthal scales bordering the canthus rostralis of similar size| 2 (exceptionally 3) postoculars on each side| 1 large, elongate supraocular on each side, 2.2–2.6 times as long as wide, 0.7– <span style="color: green;">1.0</span>  times as wide as internasal, not indented by adjacent cephalic scales| 5–9 (usually 6–7) cephalic scales on a line between supraoculars, smooth, flat and juxtaposed or barely imbricate| occipital scales larger than cephalic scales, smooth| <span style="color: red;">temporal</span>  scales smooth, large, subequal, in 2 rows anteriorly, 3 rows posteriorly| 9–13 (usually 10 or 11 ) supralabials| 1st SL always separated from nasal| 2nd SL tall, entirely bordering the anterior margin of the loreal pit, always in contact with nasal| 3rd SL longest and highest, elongate, 1.2–1.5 times as long as high, usually in contact with subocular, separated by 1 scale in 14/144 occurrences| 4th SL as long as high, as high or barely shorter than 3rd SL, either in contact with subocular (in 60/144 occurrences) or separated by 1 small scale (in 84/144 occurrences)| 5th SL usually separated from subocular by 1 scale, rarely in contact (in 18/144 occurrences)| 11–15 (usually 12–13| 16 IL in one specimen) IL| scales of the 1st pair longitudinally in contact or barely separated by the apex of the long mental scale| first three pairs of infralabials in contact with anterior chin shields| 3–6 rows of smooth gular scales| throat shields irregularly arranged. The body is robust but elongate in both males and females, or slightly thinner in males. In adults, the snout is 24.0–26.0% as long as head or 2.0–2.6 times as long as diameter of the eye. Eye large in males and juvenile specimens, average in females but rather protruding laterally, amounting for 0.6–0.9 times the distance eye–lower edge of the lip in both sexes. Ratio TaL/TL: 0.143–0.225, with a clear sexual dimorphism: males: 0.190–0.225| females: 0.143–0.185.

In our sample of 72 specimens, we examined only one specimen with 23 DSR at midbody| its dorsal scale formula is 25–23–17 (RMNH 7589). In our material, one specimen has 14 scale rows before vent, three have 17 rows.” (Vogel et al. 2022)Coloration: In life, adult specimens are pale green, bright green, grass green, dark yellowish green or olive green (deep green, bluish green or dark brown in preservative) above and on the sides, either more or less uniform, although slightly or barely paler on the lower part of the sides, or with more conspicuous paler areas, often triangular in shape with apex pointing upwards up to 4th–6th DSR, separated by areas of a darker green hue, producing a faint banded pattern| scales of the body not edged with black| interstitial skin dark grey| on each side, a series of large, more or less rounded or vertically elongate dorsolateral blotches, white, cream, pink or salmon (white or cream in preservative) on 5th–8th DSR, about 1 to 1.5 dorsal scale long and 1.5 to 2.5 scales high, longitudinally separated by 2 to 4 dorsal scales, usually more or less set off from each other on each side across vertebral line| these blotches are sometimes poorly defined or present only on the posterior half of the body| a conspicuous, broad, white, cream or pale yellow ventrolateral stripe extending from the base of the neck to the vent on the whole or greatest part of scales of the 1st DSR and on the lower part of 2nd DSR| sometimes, some irregular black spots on the anterior margin of scales of the 1st DSR, making the ventrolateral stripe broken. The background colour of the tail is of the same green as the upper body| 5 to 8 large, pinkish-red, salmon or red blotches (cream in preservative) on the upper and lateral surface of its anterior half, forming incomplete rings, becoming progressively wider and fused, and turning entirely the tail into these hues of red on its posterior half, marked with irregular paler areas of the same colour than the under surface of the tail| the ventrolateral pale stripe of the body extends along the anterior half of the tail. The upper snout and head surfaces and upper  <span style="color: red;">temporal</span>  regions are in the same hues of green as the body| snout and cephalic scales uniform or, rarely, narrowly edged with black| rostral, sides of the snout, supralabials and lower  <span style="color: red;">temporal</span>  regions are pale green, pale greenish yellow, or, often, pale blue or greenish-blue, distinctly paler than the upper head surface, without dark edges| upper snout scales, preoculars, loreals and supraoculars sometimes marbled with yellowish-ochre or pale yellowish-brown| a narrow  <span style="color: red;">temporal</span>  streak, more or less well-defined, sometimes faint, rather straight or barely oblique, white, cream, pale yellow, uniform or mixed with reddish-brown or salmon, or entirely reddish-brown, (pink or cream in preservative), extends from the eye to the corner of the mouth on the 3rd row of temporals behind the eye then on 2nd row only posteriorly| this postocular streak is present in 28 out of 30 males and 31 out of 72 females. The chin and throat are pale yellow or creamish-yellow, pale yellowish-green or, often, very pale blue or pale bluish green, with some faint darker spots posteriorly| infralabials green or distinctly pale blue. In life, the eye is dark grey, pale yellow or yellowish green. The venter is pale green, pale bluish green, pale greenish yellow or yellowish green in life (green, yellowish green or bluish green in preservative), without any black margin on ventrals. The under surface of the tail is of the same colours as the body on its anterior part, with subcaudal scales not edged with a darker hue, then quickly turns to pale pinkish-red or salmon (cream in preservative), distinctly paler than on its upper surface. Juveniles show a very similar pattern. The dorsum is usually more uniform than in adults and the pale dorsolateral spots or blotches may be missing. The pink or salmon colour of the tail is brighter than in adults but less uniform, with darker spots.” (Vogel et al. 2022)<br>

Trimeresurus macrops	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: Cryptelytrops macrops s.s. is distinguished from all other Asian pitviper species which also have the typical "green pitviper" colouration (uniform green dorsal colour and a lateral stripe present on the first few dorsal scale rows in one or both sexes), except other species of Cryptelytrops, by the presence of a fused first supralabial and nasal scale. It can be distinguished from C. albolabris, C. insularis and C. septentrionalis primarily by the relatively larger size of the eye (most obvious in adults), the relatively wider supraoculars, and the shape of the head, which is more elongate–oval in C. albolabris, C. insularis and C. septentrionalis, but widens quite abruptly behind the eyes in C. cardamomensis sp. nov., C. macrops s.s. and C. rubeus sp. nov. to give a character- istically triangular shaped head. Cryptelytrops macrops s.s. can be distinguished from both C. cardamomensis sp. nov. and C. rubeus sp. nov using the characters detailed above (further details are also given in Tables 2 and 3) [from MALHOTRA et al. 2011].<br>

Male P. buniana differ from male P. barati, P. popeiorum, and P. sabahi in having significantly fewer subcaudal scales (76–78, x=77.3, sd=1.62). Male P. buniana have a significantly shorter head (HL/SVL| 0.44–0.47, x=0.46, sd=0.023) than that of male P. barati or P. nebularis and they have a significantly longer tail (Tal/TL: 0.22–0.23, x=0.22, sd=0.006) than that of male P. nebularis and P. popeiorum. Male P. buniana differ from male P. barati, P. nebularis, and P. sabahi in having a postorbital stripe as opposed to lacking a stripe| from P. fucata in lacking white, vertebral spots as opposed to having spots| and from P. nebularis in having a bicolored, ventrolateral stripe as opposed to having a white or blue stripe. Female P. buniana differ from female P. barati and P. nebularis in having a white, ventrolateral stripe as opposed to not having stripes. Popeia buniana differs from P. popeiorum in that the ventrolateral stripe covers 50% of the scale in the first dorsal scale row as opposed to covering 100% of the scale [from GRISMER et al. 2006].Diagnosis (fucatus). A species of the genus Trimeresurus, characterized by (1) hemipenes long, reaching at least 25 th SC, without spines| (2) 1 st supralabial distinct from nasal| (3) 21 MSR (20 in 1 specimen)| (4) overall green coloration in males and females| (5) irregular rusty or reddish-brown dorsal crossbands in most males| (6) a vertebral row of white dots in males, especially those from southern Thailand and Pulau Tioman, conspicuous in life (often invisible in preserved specimens or in living old specimens), present also in females, especially in juvenile specimens from same areas| (7) in males, a postocular streak usually thin, irregular, either entirely white or white below with an irregular, dark red or rusty brown streak above, sometimes totally absent (this streak is often much sub-dued and invisible in preservative)| this streak is absent in females, but some white spots may be present| (8) eyes yellowish-green, greenish-gold or yellow-copper in both sexes in adult specimens| (9) in males, a vivid, bicolor ventrolateral stripe, bright and deep orange or red below, white above| in females, a thin, white but well defined stripe| (10) a tail entirely rusty brown or reddish-brown in the northern part of the range, mottled in the southern part| (11) a long tail in males, with a ratio TaL/TL between 0.200 and more than 0.240| (12) a high number of SC in males (at least 69)| (13) occipital and  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">temporal</span> </span>  scales distinctly keeled| (14) an elongated snout, oblically truncated (from VOGEL et al. 2004).Comparison. Main characters separating Trimeresurus fucatus from other taxa of the group are given in Tables 12–13. Trimeresurus fucatus differs from its “northern” relative Trimeresurus popeiorum by (1) the presence of dorsal crossbands in males of most populations| (2) the colour of the tail (see the description) in the northern populations| (3) the colour of the eyes: green or greenish-gold or copper in T. f ucatus, vs. deep red in T. popeiorum| (4) the postocular streak in males, in T. fucat us sometimes absent, or white, or white with a dark red upper part (see Vogel [1990]) vs. always wide and vividly bicolor in T. popeiorum| (5) the postocular streak in females, lacking in females of T. fucatus, faint but present in T. popeiorum| (6) a higher value of TaL/TL in males (0.201–0.241 [x = 0.218, s = 0.001] vs. in T. popeiorum 0.181–0.211 [x = 0.195, s = 0.009]| U = 4.5, P < 0.001)| (7) a higher number of SC in males (69–84 [x = 75.9, s = 3.5] vs. 59–75 [x = 68.1, s = 4.2] in T. popeiorum| U = 58, P < 0.001)| (8) a more elongated, flattened head and oblically truncated snout| (9) a slightly smaller size in T. fucatus compared to T. popeiorum. Trimeresurus fucatus differs from the Sundaic species of the complex (see below) by (1) the presence of dorsal crossbands in most males| (2) the presence of a conspicuous white ventrolateral stripe in females (also present in Trimeresurus sabahi)| (3) the pres-ence of dorsal white spots in many specimens of T. fucatus, although, according to Stuebing & Inger (1999), white dots are sometimes present in Trimeresurus sabahi| (4) higher numbers of ventral scales in males and in females| (5) occipital and  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">temporal</span> </span>  scales strongly keeled in T. fucatus, smooth or much more weakly keeled in Sundaic species (from VOGEL et al. 2004). Diagnosis (toba): A species of the genus Trimeresurus Lacépède, 1804, characterized by (1) hemipenes long, reaching in situ at least the 25th sC, without spines| (2) 1st supralabial distinct from nasal| (3) 21 msr| (4) overall green coloration in males and females without darker crossbands| (5) absence of a postocular streak in both males and females| (6) thin, white ventrolateral stripe present in males, faint but present or absent in females| (7) rather short tail in females with a ratio taL/tL between 0.148 and 0.157| (8) occipital scales smooth or weakly keeled| and (9) <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">temporal</span> </span>  scales large, as large as posterior temporals.Comparisons: Trimeresurus sabahi differs from all other pitvi-pers of the Trimeresurus popeiorum complex mostly by the combination of the following characters:(1) the eye colour, red or orange-red in both males and females| (2) no postocu-lar streak in males and females| (4) a bicolor ventrolateral stripe in males, red below/white above, only white or yellow in females| (5) a low ventral count in males and females| (6) occipital and  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">temporal</span> </span>  scales smooth or very weakly keeled. Main characters separating Trimeresurus sabahi from other taxa of the group are given in Tables 12–13. T. sabahi differs from T. popeiorum by (1) a smaller size| (2) by the absence of postocular streaks in both sexes| (3) a lower number of Cep between the supraoculars (9–11 [x = 10.3, s = 0.8] vs. in T. popeiorum 10–14 [x = 11.5, s = <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">1.0</span> </span> ]| U = 45.5| P < 0.05)])| (4) a lower number of VEN in females (148–156 vs. 154–168 in T. popeiorum)| (5) occipital and  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">temporal</span> </span>  scales smooth, vs. distinctly or strongly keeled in T. popeiorum. Trimeresurus sabahi differs from T. fucatus by (1) a smaller size| (2) the absence of dorsal crossbands in T. sabahi| (3) the colour of the eyes in males and females (red in T.  sabahi vs. yellowish-green or gold or copper in T. fucat us)| (4) the absence of vertebral white spots in T. sabahi, although, according to Stuebing & Inger (1999), white dots are sometimes present| (5) the tail pattern| (6) a higher number of ventral scales in both sexes of T. f ucat us (in males 156–171 [x = 164.0, s = 3.5] vs. 147–157 [x = 151.6, s = 2.8] in T. sabahi| U = 1.5| P < 0.001| in females 157–170 [x = 163.5, s = 3.4] vs. in T. sabahi 148– 156 [x = 152.2, s = 3.0])| (7) by weakly keeled or smooth occipital and  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">temporal</span> </span>  scales in T. sabahi, strongly keeled in T. f ucatus.<br>

Vipera berus	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis (Pelias): Small and medium snakes, the largest species do not exceed  <span style="color: green;">900 mm</span>  in  <span style="color: red;">length</span>  including a tail. The head is covered on top by small scales and large regular shaped scutes. The frontal, paired temporal and paired supraorbital scutes are the largest. The nasal scute is separated from the intermaxillar by nasomaxillar scutes. The body scales are strongly costate. The  <span style="color: red;">ventral scutes</span>  are  <span style="color: green;">128–157</span>  <span style="color: red;">subcaudal</span>  <span style="color: green;">21–46</span>  pairs in two rows and the anal scute is whole. All species are ovoviviparous (Tuniyev et al. 2019: 126)Melanistic morphs in V. berus are common and appear to have some selective advantage, at least in colder climates, hence they are maintained over many decades (Madsen et al. 2022).<br>

Montivipera bornmuelleri	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: A species of viper within the Vipera xanthina species-group, characterized by having a much reduced dorsal pattern. This pattern is split up into small irregular bars and blotches, normally between 47 and 64 (^ = 52) on body. In young specimens the pattern is more similar to that in V. xanthina, while the central part of each dorsal blotch fades away during early growth, thus leaving only the dark edges of the blotches left. This results in an irregularly spotted or crossbanded pattern. Belly finely dotted without dark blotches. It is a species of small to medium size, often not exceeding 50 cm length in the wild, but can grow bigger. <span style="color: red;">midbody scale rows</span>  <span style="color: green;">23</span>  or more rarely 21. Comparatively short tail with only  <span style="color: green;">23</span>  to 26 subcaudals in females and 28 to 31 in males, compared to more than 27 in female xanthina and between 30 and 37 in male xanthina. Further it differs from V. xanthina and V. wagneri in having a lower ventral count (142 to 153, x = 147.8 in females compared to between 148 and 169 in female xanthina and around 161 in female wagneri| and 144 to 152, x = 148.4, in males compared to between 151 and 167 in male xanthina). Vipera bornmuelleri often has three  <span style="color: red;">apicals</span> (62 %) in contact with rostral while V. xanthina and V. wagneri has two. <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span>  nine on each side, while V. xanthina regularly has ten. Vipera bornmuelleri differs from V. bulgardaghica by not having the upper preocular in contact with nasal, in having  <span style="color: green;">21 or more scales</span>  in  <span style="color: red;">first circumocular rings</span> (counted together), and 25 or more in second rings (21 or less in first and 25 or less in second circumocular rings in V. bulgardaghica), and in having 2 scale rows between eye and  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span> (one in V. bulgardaghica). Vipera bornmuelleri is also separated from xanthina and bulgardaghica by having a higher number of intercanthals and inter-supraoculars (42 — 60 counted together, compared to between 30 and 50 in the latter two) (from Nilson & Andrén 1986: 42).<br>
<i>intercanthals and inter-supraoculars: 42-60</i><br>
<i>scales between eye and supralabials: 2.0</i><br>
<i>second circumocular rings: 25 or more scales</i><br>

It differs from all other vipers under comparison by a maximum number of zigzag wings in  <span style="color: red;">males</span>  which is less only than in  <span style="color: red;">females</span>  of the nominate subspecies| comparatively high number of sublabials. From above, <span style="color: red;">males</span>  are painted in grey and yellowish-grey tones, and  <span style="color: red;">females</span>  in yellowishgrey and light brown tones| zigzag in both sexes consists of numerous transversely elongated spots, interrupted only in some places. The belly is light grey to black in  <span style="color: red;">females</span>  and spotty black, or almost black in  <span style="color: red;">males</span> Diagnosis (olguni). Small-sized snake, different from a related species Darevsky’s viper by the having smaller sizes of trunk, body, tail, lower number of preventrals, sublabials and wings of zigzag| by the having higher number of scales round a neck and middle of body, <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span>  and crown shields. Parietal shields have incision in most of the specimens. Animals from above are painted in gray and russet tones| a zigzag does not consist of numerous transversal prolate spots, only in some part united. Belly from dark spotted to almost black.<br>

Vipera dinniki	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis (tuniyevi). Small-sized snake, males differ from all representatives of Pelias kaznakovi s.l. by minimal values of total length, length of pileus, width of head, numbers of ventral and subcaudal shields, and shields around eyes| females have minimal body length, length of pileus, width of head, number of shields around eyes and loreals, number of zigzag wings. The vipers of both sexes from the left-bank basin of the middle flow of the Kura River differ from all other compared vipers by small sizes and the minimum number of shields around the eyes. The dorsal surface of the males is beige-gray, yellowish-gray, rarely brownish-reddish, or yellow| the dorsal surface of the females is pinkish-gray, light brown, gray-yellow or melanistic. The majority of females has a  <span style="color: green;">weakly undulated</span>  <span style="color: red;">zigzag pattern</span>  ranging in color from light- to dark-brown| the  <span style="color: red;">zigzag pattern</span>  of males is black or brown-black, with sharp wings and occasional interruptions. The throat in both sexes is light-colored, the belly is usually gray-spotted against a dark background| the lower part of the tail in both sexes is pinkish with varying numbers of dots in males and without dots in females (Ananjeva et al. 2021).<br>

Vipera kaznakovi	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis (magnifica). A small viper of the Eurosiberian group. Coloration is not bright. Number of ventral shields and number of crown shields are the biggest for all representatives of "kaznakovi" complex.Coloration: there are melanistic and brown/black variants as well as intermediates (Tuniyev et al. 2016). Sindaco 2013: 410 shows a striped variant. Werner 1924 calls the melanistic form “prester”.<br>
<br>
Vipera latastei	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis (latastei): In relation to the other Iberian Lataste's viper subspecies, specimens of V. l. latastei reach in average larger sizes (SVL), present lower num- ber of periocular scales and higher number of subcaudal scales (both in females and males), and are characterized by the predominance of angular zigzag dorsal patterns with higher number of dorsal marks (see Figure 4a–e| Table S6 in MARTÍNEZ-FREIRÍA et al. 2021).Diagnosis (arundana): In relation to the other Iberian subspecies, vipers of V. l. arundana reach in average intermediate size (SVL), present higher number of periocular scales and lower number of subcaudal scales (both in fe- males and males), and present both wide angular and rounded zig- zag dorsal patterns with intermediate number of dorsal marks (see Figure 4j,k| Table S6 in MARTÍNEZ-FREIRÍA et al. 2021).Diagnosis (gaditana): In relation to the other Iberian subspecies, individuals of V. l. ga- ditana reach in average smaller sizes (SVL), present intermediate number of periocular scales and number of subcaudal scales (both in females and males), and are characterized by the predominance of rounded zigzag dorsal patterns with low number of dorsal marks (see Figure 4f–i| Table S6 in MARTÍNEZ-FREIRÍA et al. 2021).<br>

<br>
Vipera monticola	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis (monticola): In relation to the other North African Mountain viper subspecies, V. m. monticola presents small size (but larger than the specimens from Western High Atlas), low number of intercanthal + intrasupraocular, loreal and periocular scales, moderate number of ventral scales, 19 dorsal rows (a characteristic also shared with vipers from other lineages), high number of dorsal marks and frequently, a barred dorsal pattern (a characteristic also shared with specimens from the Western High Atlas). Only dwarf specimens are known (see Table S7). See Figure 5a–c in MARTÍNEZ-FREIRÍA et al. 2021.Diagnosis (atlantica): In relation to the other North African Mountain viper subspecies, Vipera m. atlantica presents the smallest size, the highest number of intercanthal + intrasupraocular and ventral scales, moderate number of loreal and periocular scales, 19 dorsal rows (a characteristic shared with V. m. monticola and few specimens from the Rif-E.Atl-Alg lineage), moderate number of dorsal marks and frequently, a barred dorsal pattern (a characteristic also shared with V. m. monticola). Only dwarf specimens are known, resembling V. m. monticola but with previous mentioned differences (see Figure 5d,e| Table S7 in MARTÍNEZ-FREIRÍA et al. 2021).Diagnosis (saintgironsi): In relation to the other North African Mountain viper subspecies, V. m. saintgironsi presents larger size, moderate number of intercanthal + intrasupraocular scales, high number of loreal and periocular scales, low number of ventral scales, 19 to 23, frequently 21 dorsal rows at midbody, low number of dorsal marks, and variable dorsal pattern (including the three general types| see Figure 5f,j| Table S7). Specimens with dwarf characteristics (i.e., small size and 19 dorsal rows) are known for the Eastern High Atlas Mountains in Morocco (Figure 5H) and the Aurès Mountains in Algeria (i.e., paratype MNCN 50498, Appendix 3 in MARTÍNEZ-FREIRÍA et al. 2021).<br>

<br>
Montivipera xanthina	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis (nilsoni): M. x. nilsoni is distinct from the typical form as it is far larger in size that the standard type (males up to 140 cm in total length and weighing almost 1300 g, respectively, up to 95 cm and 380 g on the continent)| for the tendency to have three rows of unilateral or bilateral circumocular scales (instead of two)| for the larger number of rows of anterior dorsal scales (average  about 24 instead of 23)| for the more extensive development of the dorsal pattern and absence or poor definition of the ventral semilunar  <span style="color: red;">spots</span>  in the adult.Diagnosis (dianae): M. x. dianae differs from the typical form as it has a larger number of rows of dorsal (with consequent increase in size) and anterior (25) scales, and also at mid-trunk (24 or 25, almost never 23) and to the rear (often 18 and 19) (in the typical form habitual respective values are 23, 23 and 17), as well as having a  <span style="color: green;">dark</span>  <span style="color: red;">subocular spot</span>  with the two black specks on the pileus mostly absent or poorly represented. It also presents unusual, paroxysmal or extreme defensive reactions, never found in specimens of M. xanthina elsewhere.Diagnosis (occidentalis): M. x. occidentalis differs from other known subspecies for the tendency to a reduced size and correspondingly for a lower number of intercanthals and of dorsal scales rows, both in the midbody (mostly 21-22) and in the posterior part of the body (often 15-16). Diagnosis (varoli): This subspecies has similar characteristics with those of the southern populations according to Nilson & Andren (1986). The  <span style="color: red;">whiteness</span>  between  <span style="color: red;">spots</span>  and zig-zag windings in the dorsum is  <span style="color: green;">more prominent</span>  in the new subspecies than in the southern population, and females have  <span style="color: green;">darker greyish-brown</span>  skin color than males. <span style="color: red;">whiteness</span>  between  <span style="color: green;">blackish</span>  <span style="color: red;">spots</span>  can be also  <span style="color: green;">more prominent</span>  in male specimens compared to only adult female specimen. In three male specimens, there was almost no spotting and  <span style="color: red;">colorization</span>  under the head. The  <span style="color: red;">spots</span>  on ventrals became denser in the mid-body and forms darker  <span style="color: red;">colorization</span>  at the end of body. Also, just as stated in Nilson & Andren (1986), in three of the four evaluated specimens, they have  <span style="color: red;">neck  <span style="color: red;">spots</span> </span>  <span style="color: green;">united with the dorsal band</span>  The tail tips of all four specimens are yellowish-orange or light orange while tail tip is yellow for other M. xanthina populations according to Nilson & Andren (1986). In addition to color-pattern properties, new subspecies are differ from M. x. nilsoni by having two series of circumocular scales which is similar to nominate subspecies| M. x. dianae by having lower number of rows of dorsal scales (anterior 23-24| mid-body 23| posterior 17-18)| M. x. occidentalis a higher number of intercanthals and dorsal scales rows. Also new subspecies can be distinguished from other M. xanthina populations in Turkey by both having more intercanthals (12, 13) and less  <span style="color: red;">subcaudalia</span> ( <span style="color: green;">≤30</span> ).<br>

Protobothrops sieversorum	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis (Triceratolepidophis): A genus of Asian pitviper belonging to the Trimeresurus group, characterized by a large  <span style="color: red;">size</span>  reaching at least  <span style="color: green;">1255 mm</span> | elongated head and body| the presence of a nasal pore| strongly keeled dorsal scales, bearing an elongated longitudinal keel covering at least two thirds of the length of the scale, made o f a series o f three consecutive horns or crests, high and wide, rising progressively from front to back, separated by two lower but distinctively elevated parts (Fig.7a d), producing very strongly keeled dorsal scales| a tessellate fimbriate microdermatoglyphic pattern of dorsal scales with distinctly raised fimbriae| raised, hom-like multiple supraoculars| cephalic scales on upper head surface between supraoculars distinctly keeled for a part, all becoming progressively strongly keeled towards the occipital region| and a grayish brown ground color with a blotched dorsal pattern.Triceratolepidophis, although sharing several morphological similarities with other members ofthe genera Trimeresurus and Protobothrops, such as the ground color, blotched dorsal pattern, the upraised supraoculars. and head scalation, differs from all other Asian crotaline genera currently recognized in David and Ineich (1999), namely Calloselasma Cope,1860, Deinagkistrodon Gloyd, 1979, Ermia Zhang, 1993, Gloydius Hoge and Romano Hoge, 1981, Hypnale Fitzinger, 1843, Ovophis Burger in Hoge and Romano Hoge, 1981, Protobothrops Hoge and Romano Hoge, 1983, Trimeresurus Lacepecte, 1804, and Tropidolaemus Wagler, 1830, by the unique autapomorph scale structure as well as the unique microdermatoglyphic pattern of the Oberhautchen, which is tessellate fimbriate due to the upraising of the fimbriae. This structure is unique in the Trimeresurus group, in which other species have only the tessellate pattern typical of the Crotalinae (Ziegler et al. 2000: 201).Diagnosis: An Asian pitviper of the Trimeresurus group, characterized by the main diagnostic features given above for the genus, namely a large  <span style="color: red;">size</span>  at least up to  <span style="color: green;">1255 mm</span> | elongated head and body| strongly keeled dorsal scales due to the presence on most o f them o f an elongated longitudinal keel made of a series of three consecutive, high and wide hom/crest-like summits, rising progressively from front to back, separated by two lower but distinctively elevated parts (Fig. 7a-d )| the tessellate fimbriate microdennatoglyphic pattern o f dorsal scales| raised, hom-like multiple supraoculars| cephalic scales between supraoculars keeled for a part and becoming progressively strongly keeled backwards on the occipital region| and an overall grayish ground color. Other diagnostic characters include the following features: 23 dorsal scale rows at midbody| high numbers of ventral and subcaudal plates, 228 and 82 respectively| 8-9 supralabials, first totally separated from nasal, the longest being numbers 4 and 5: upper preocular divided into 3 consecutive small scales, from front to back one large and two small| a single true loreal| 5th supralabial approximately as high and wide as the 4th| and a lower row of temporals much larger than upper rows.This species is distinguishable from all other Asian pitvipers by the unique macroand microstructures of the dorsal scales. The combination of other morphological characters are also sufficient to separate this species from all other known Asian pitvipers. However, the ground color and hom-like supra- oculars make it superficially similar to some other members of the genus Trimeresurus, namely T. cornutus and T. puniceus. Nevertheless, general habitus, color and pattern as well as meristic characters are shared by several species of the genus Protobothrops, especially P. mucrosquamatus.From the other homed species of the Trimeresurus group, Triceratolepidophis sieversorum is immediately distinguished by the strongly and uniquely keeled dorsal scales| furthermore, the structure of the supraoculars is different from T. cornutus, in which the 3 or 4 horns are convergent and confluent at their tips, whereas they are divergent and free in the new species. From the Indo-Malayan T. puniceus, it differs by the diagnostic characters given above, and much higher numbers of ventral and subcaudal plates. Other Indo-Malayan homed species, T. borneensis Peters, 1872 and T. brongersmai Hoge, 1969, also exhibit much lower numbers of ventral and subcaudal plates, and a strongly projected spatulate nose.From Protobothrops mucrosquamatus, to which superficially it is quite similar, this new taxon differs by the keels of the dorsal scales as well as a completely different microdermatoglyphic pattern, which is typically tessellate in P. mucrosquamatus, but also by the presence of raised supraoculars and an upper preocular divided into 3 scales instead of two as in P. mucrosquamatus.<br>

Bothriechis thalassinus	Serpentes	Viperidae	Definition and diagnosis.–A moderately sized (up to almost a meter in total length), green, arboreal pitviper in which the tail comprises between 16-18% of the TL in males and females. There are  <span style="color: green;">5-9</span> (x = 7.7) <span style="color: red;">intersupraoculars</span>  that are distinctly keeled, <span style="color: green;">23-26</span> (x = 24.1) <span style="color: red;">interrictals</span>  that are also keeled, <span style="color: green;">161-168</span>  <span style="color: red;">ventrals</span>  <span style="color: green;">60-67</span>  undivided  <span style="color: red;">subcaudals</span>  and usually  <span style="color: green;">21</span> (rarely 23) <span style="color: red;">dorsal scale rows</span>  at midbody.Bothriechis schlegelii occurs on the same slopes as B. thalassinus but generally at lower elevations. Small, spinelike supraciliary scales between the eye and supraoculars and usually at least 23  <span style="color: red;">dorsal scale rows</span>  at midbody distinguish B. schlegelii from B. thalassinus. Two other congeners that occur on the Atlantic slopes of northern Central America, but rarely, if ever, are sympatric with B. thalassinus, include. Bothriechis aurifer has a dorsal pattern of yellow blotches edged with a black border that is often fused between adjacent blotches, only 1-5  <span style="color: red;">intersupraoculars</span>  and usually 19  <span style="color: red;">dorsal scale rows</span>  at midbody. Bothriechis marchi has irregular, mostly flat scales on the crown, at least a few of which are usually conspicuously larger than surrounding scales, 3-7  <span style="color: red;">intersupraoculars</span>  and usually 19 scales at midbody. Bothriechis rowleyi of Oaxaca and Chiapas, Mexico, may be distinguished from B. thalassinus in having 3-5  <span style="color: red;">intersupraoculars</span>  that are irregularly shaped, the adjacent scales on the crown lacking parallel keeling, and 19  <span style="color: red;">dorsal scale rows</span>  present at midbody.Bothriechis thalassinus most closely resembles B. bicolor of the Pacific slopes of southern Mexico and Guatemala, but B. bicolor differs in having more  <span style="color: red;">intersupraoculars</span> (8-10, x = 8.7, in males| 8-11, x = 10.0 in females) and  <span style="color: red;">interrictals</span> (27-31, x = 28.5, in males| 27-33, x = 30.3, in females). There is also a subtle difference in the shape of the first pair of infralabials. In B. bicolor these scales are relatively broad, whereas in B. thalassinus they are narrower and the exposure of the scales along the lingual margin is often reduced.Two montane congeners occur south of the Nicaraguan Depression in Costa Rica and Panama. Bothriechis nigroviridis has a green body heavily speckled or mottled with black on the sides and the dorsum, fewer  <span style="color: red;">ventrals</span> (139-158) and  <span style="color: red;">subcaudals</span> (47-58), and usually 19  <span style="color: red;">dorsal scale rows</span>  at midbody. Bothriechis lateralis has distinctive yellow paravertebral vertical bars and yellow paraventral stripes on the body. Further, there are usually 23 midbody  <span style="color: red;">dorsal scale rows</span>  in this species. [from CAMPBELL & SMITH 2000].<br>

Atheris hirsuta	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: Slender tree viper with rather short head, IOD (Interorbital distance) / SED (Snout-eye distance) = <span style="color: green;">2</span> .3| heavily carinated scales, especially on head and neck, giving the snake a bristly appearance| keels. run in long curves towards a sharp tip| six  <span style="color: red;">suprarostrals</span> | eight to nine infralabials| three pairs of sublinguals| elongate dorsal scales| 16 scale rows around mid-body.Comparisons: Atheris hirsuta sp. nov. resembles A. squamigera in appearance but can be distinguished from the latter by several morphometric, and morphological characters. Its most intriguing difference is the elongated dorsal scalation, especially on the head and anterior body, which could not be observed to such an extent in any specimens of A. squamigera. Further distinguishing characters were: the number and arrangement of  <span style="color: red;">suprarostrals</span> (SRO) (six in A. hirsuta| three or up to eight inA. squamigera, but usually odd numbers occur)| the number of pairs of sublinguals (PSL) (three pairs in A. hirsuta| four to seven in A. squamigera)| and the shape of the head and neck scales. Scales in A. squamigera are never as strongly bent as in A. hirsuta (Fig. <span style="color: green;">2</span>  d, e), which in this respect appears similar to A. hispida and A. acuminata. Atheris hirsuta has a much shorter snout and larger eye than A. squamigera, giving the head a more blunt and stocky appearance. This is expressed by the IOD/SED index, which is  <span style="color: green;">2</span> .3 in A. hirsuta, compared with a maximum of 1.9 (mean 1.7) in A. squamigera. The number of mid-dorsal scale rows (MSR) in the holotype of A. hirsuta is comparatively low - only 16, which equals the lowest counts found in A. squamigera (SMNS 4213| 2MB 20481).Atheris hirsuta differed from the sympatric A. chlorechis by the number of  <span style="color: red;">suprarostrals</span> (7-8 in A. chlorechis, arranged in alower row offour and an upper row of three to four scales) and the maximum transverse head scale count (MTHS) between the posterior  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span> (SL) (25-27 in A. chlorechis| 14 in A. hirsuta). Atheris chlorechis has higher infralabial counts (IL) (10-11| 8-9 in A. hirsuta) and higher numbers of dorsal scale rows at mid-body (25-37). Scales of A. chlorechis are not as strongly keeled and the keel only stretches across two thirds o f the entire scale, leaving a smooth, slightly depressed area uncovered. Our SEM-photos o f A. hirsuta revealed no serration o f keels on lateral scales, known to occur in some A. chlorechis (Groombridge, 1980, cited by Broadley, 1996, 1998).Atheris hirsuta differs from the East African species A. nitschei, A. rungweensis, A. desaixi, A. katangensis and A. ceratophora by having fewer transverse head scales, fewer interocunasals (ION) and higher numbers of dorsal scale rows at mid-body. Dorsal scalation in these species is never as elongate as in A. hirsuta. The latter lacks serrated keels on lateral scales, present in the species mentioned above. The lack of elongate supraoculars that form hom-like projections above theeyes furthermore distinguishes A. hirsuta from A. ceratophora. Keels in A. rungweensis and A. desaixi end before the scale tip, whereas they reach the tip in the other members of this group, as well as in A. hirsuta. A. rungweensis and A. desaixi have more interoculabials (IOL), as well as higher numbers of infralabials. The number of pairs of sublinguals is higher in A. desaixi. Atheris broadleyi from Cameroon is distinguished from A. hirsuta by having more interoculabials, a higher number of scale rows at mid-body and fewer interorbitals (IOS), and by its consistent dorsal colour pattern, also used to distinguish it from the closely related A. squamigera (Lawson, 1999). Two distinctive East African species, A. hispida and A. acuminata, also posses acuminate or lanceolate dorsal scales, but differ from A. hirsuta by having fewer transverse head scales and a lower number of  <span style="color: red;">suprarostrals</span>  as well as fewer pairs ofsublinguaIs. In addition, A. hispida has a higher number of interocunasals. Atheris acuminata has a lower number of circumorbital scales, as well as lower numbers of supralabiaIs. For a summary of differences between A. hirsuta and other Atheris species, see Table 4 (in Ernst & Rödel 2002).Coloration. Dorsal coloration in life is bronze| several scale tips and keels being dark-brown, forming an irregular pattern of broken crossbars| ventrally cream-white to yellowish| iris yellow (Fig. 3). In preservative (3 % formaldehyde transferred to 70 % ethanol after two months), colour changed to reddish-brown dorsally| ventral scales turned uniform clear reddish brown, being more intense in posterior third of body and tail, fading anteriorly.The key to the genus Atheris on p. 74 of Chippaux & Jackson 2019, says that A. hirsuta can be distinguished from A. hispida by its possession of only one row of scales between the eye and the nasal, while in reality it has two rows, as can be seen in the original description of A. hirsuta and on the photos provided by Penner et al. (2013) and by Chippaux and Jackson themselves (Pauwels & Brecko 2020).<br>

Trimeresurus nebularis differs from Trimeresurus sabahi by: (1) a larger size| (2) the colour of the eyes (green vs. bright red in T. sabahi)| (3) the pattern of the tail| (4) the presence of ventrolateral stripes in both sexes of T. sabahi| (5) a lower number of SC in both sexes (in males 61–65 [x = 63.0, s = 2.8] vs. 69–76 [x = 71.6, s = 2.5] in T. sabahi| in females 50–60 [x = 55.2, s = 3.8] vs. in T. sabahi 59–65 [x = 62.2, s = 2.7])| (6) the contact of 3 rd SL with the subocular, in contact in all examined specimens of T. nebularis, sepa-rated in 14/20 occurrences in T. sabahi| (7) by proportionnally wider supraocular scales in T. nebularis (ratio L–SpOc/W–SpOc: 2.4–2.8 ([x = 2.5, s = 0.1] in T. nebul ari s, vs. 2.8–3.3 [x = 3.0, s = 0.2] in T. sabahi).

Popeia inornata is distinguished from members of  Cryptelytrops by full separation of the first supralabial  and nasal scales. It is distinguished from other members  of Popeia by the absence of a red or orange lateral stripe  in adult males. Both sexes of P. inornata are separated  from P. popeiorum sensu stricto by low ventral scale  counts (no higher than 156, compared to no lower than  158), and from both P. popeiorum and the southern clade  species by green eye coloration, with the exception of  West Malaysian representatives of the southern clade,  from which P. inornata can be distinguished by low ventral scale counts alone (149 – 156 vs. 157 – 172). With  respect to the classification of Regenass and Kramer  (1981), P. inornata is distinguished from the Borneo  population (T. p. sabahi sensu Regenass and Kramer,  1981) by the absence of a red or orange lateral stripe in  adult males and by green eye coloration in both sexes. It  differs from snakes from the Barisan range of western  Sumatra (T. p. barati sensu Regenass and Kramer, 1981)  in having a longer and less compact head, a coloration of  interstitial skin and dorsal scale bases that forms black  bands with narrow light blue interspaces (vs. no dark  bands on uniformly bluish gray to blue interstitial skin),  and lower and upper margins of supralabials and infralabials, respectively, that are distinctly blue in life (vs.  bluish white to lighter blue). Popeia inornata is further  distinguished from west Sumatran specimens by the dorsal coloration of the tail which in life is a well-defined  and solid brick red with light margins on red dorsal  scales (vs. a light brown to golden hue which is less  clearly demarcated laterally). While Regenass and Kramer (1981) distinguished T. p. barati on the basis of  lower midbody dorsal scale counts (17 – 19 vs. 21 in the  rest of their T. popeiorum group), an additional specimen examined by Sanders, Malhotra, and Thorpe  (unpublished) from west Sumatra has 21 scale rows.  Additional morphological characters that can be used  in combination to diagnose the new species are listed  in Table 1| diagnostic molecular characters are given  above (3.2).Popeia inornata is not known to share its geographic range with any other green pitviper species. It is  easily distinguished from juvenile and adult male Tropidolaemus wagleri (Boie, 1827) by the distinct red and  white pre- and postocular stripe, red and white dorsal  bands or spots, and keeled scales on the lower side of the  head possessed by the latter species. Adult females of  T. wagleri are even more distinct from P. inornata due to  their highly divergent, largely black and yellow coloration and relatively massive girth. The new species can  be distinguished from Parias hageni (Lidth de Jeude,  1886) by the dorsal coloration and pattern of the tail,  which in Pa. hageni is green with a few irregular reddish-brown spots, and solid reddish-brown only in about  the distal half of the tail (vs. laterally well-defined and  solid brick red from about the anal region to the tip in  P. inornata).<br>

Tropidolaemus laticinctus	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: A species of Tropidolaemus, an Asian pitviper genus characterized by strongly keeled gular scales, a splenial that is separate from the angular (Burger 1971), and a unique dorsal scale microdermatoglyphic pattern of rounded cells that are strongly covered with longitudinal parallel lines and comb-like ridges (Hoge & Romano-Hoge 1983| striocristate pattern subtype sensu Price 1982, verified in ZMB 47809). Tropidolaemus laticinctus differs from all congeners by the following combination of characters: lack of pronounced sexual or ontogenetic differences in color pattern| presence of ornate head pattern with brown dorsal markings on green ground that are bordered by cream scales and are largest on the posterior head| wide brown pre- and postocular stripe that extends to lower side of head beyond angle of jaw| ornate labial pattern consisting of brown spots bordered by white or black, on green to cream ground color| conspicuous large brown spot extending from anteroventral corner of eye and posteroventral margin of pit to lower margin of supralabials| lower side of head with similar pattern as dorsal side of head, or mottled with numerous brown and black spots and streaks| dorsal body pattern consisting of broad brick-red to brown rings that may be incomplete dorsally or laterally and are about as wide as or wider than the cream to white interspaces| anterodorsal part of light interspaces of body pattern containing wide green bands| brown rings across belly connected midventrally to form midventral stripe (if brown rings incomplete ventrally, venter heavily spotted, with chessboardlike pattern)| base of tail with whitish and brown rings, tip of tail lighter reddish brown with no or only indistinct bands. Tropidolaemus wagleri differs from T. laticinctus in having distinct sexual differences in color pattern, in females undergoing a dramatic ontogenetic color change from a bright green ground color to a largely black and yellow coloration with or without green components, in lacking an extensively patterned venter, and in lacking an ornate labial pattern. Juvenile females of T. wagleri further differ from T. laticinctus in having a dorsal pattern of very narrow red and white bands on bright green ground color and in lacking a dorsal head pattern| male T. wagleri of all ages differ from T. laticinctus in having a dorsal pattern of tiny red and white spots and in lacking a dorsal head pattern. Members of the T. subannulatus complex (including the types of Trimesurus [sic] philippensis Gray, 1842, Trimesurus [sic] subannulatus Gray, 1842, and Trigonocephalus wagleri var. celebensis Gray, 1849) differ from T. laticinctus in lacking a well-defined ornate head pattern with light-bordered dorsal markings and in lacking an ornate labial pattern, in lacking a ventral pattern of brown rings and/or midventral stripe, and in having a dorsal pattern of narrow bands or spots (vs. broad brickred to brown rings). Both sexes of sympatric members of the T. subannulatus complex differ from T. laticinctus in having a uniform or near-uniform green dorsal head color (fig. 8C in KUCH et al. 2007, vs. ornate brown head pattern), a narrower bluish (vs. wide brown) pre- and postocular stripe and largely patternless labial region (fig. 7C, vs. ornate labial pattern), the presence (vs. absence) of well-defined, black-edged ocelli on outer posterior margins of ventral scales (fig. 7C), and an otherwise uniform green to bluish green venter (vs. heavily patterned venter with brown rings and midventral stripe). Sympatric members of the T. subannulatus complex further differ from T. laticinctus in having narrow white and bluish or reddish bands or spots on uniform green ground color (fig. 11C, vs. broad brick-red to brown rings), and in having a tail pattern consisting of narrow bluish bands and wide green interspaces at the base and nearly equidistant, distinct narrow black and white bands on brownish to greyish ground towards the tail tip (fig. 11C, vs. well-defined, approximately equidistant light and brown rings on base of tail, and light reddish brown tail tip with no or only indistinct bands). Adult females of sympatric members of the T. subannulatus complex also differ from the adult female T. laticinctus illustrated by de Lang & Vogel (2005, 2006) in having a yellow to golden (figs. 7C, 11C| vs. reddish) eye color. In characters of scalation, the specimens of the available small series of T. laticinctus (N=5) differ from the examined T. subannulatus complex members from Sulawesi (N=16) in having a slightly convex anterior margin of the mental scale (vs. centrally concave when viewed from the same angle, or indented at the level of the tongue), and in having higher ventral scale counts (139–146 vs. 134–139, respectively). The females of T. laticinctus (N=3) also differ from the majority of examined T. subannulatus complex females from Sulawesi (11 of 13) in having a higher number of dorsal scale rows at midbody (25 vs. 23, respectively).<br>

Valencia et al. (2016) reported maximum total lengths of 2,327 mm for males and 2,342 mm for females in Ecuador. The maximum total length reported for the species is 300 cm (Campbell and Lamar 2004).Lachesis acrochorda and L. stenophrys are externally similar but usually can be distinguished by the latter having 191–209 ventrals (202–228 in L. acrochorda) and usually few if any dark spots on the top of the  <span style="color: red;">head</span> (distinctly marked with dark spots and lines or “Ripa’s arabesques” in L. acrochorda| Ripa 1999| Campbell and Lamar 2004). Lachesis acrochordais most similar to L. muta, although Campbell and Lamar (2004)  indicated  that  they  differ  in  body  shape  (L.  muta  round in cross-section, L. acrochorda tall and compressed)| however, we cannot corroborate this distinction, as our expe-riences indicated that the body shapes of all congeners can vary in response to different factors (from Barrio-Amorós et zl. 2020).<br>

Crotalus ericsmithi	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: Distinguished from all other rattlesnakes except C. stejnegeri and C. lannomi in having a long tail (15.9% of TL in adult male holotype) with a  <span style="color: red;">tiny rattle</span> (proximal rattle segment  <span style="color: green;">2.2 mm</span>  in holotype) <span style="color: red;">canthals</span>  relatively  <span style="color: green;">large</span>  and separated by  <span style="color: green;">two</span> (anteriorly) or a single (posteriorly) small scales ( <span style="color: red;">canthals</span>  moderately small and sepa- rated by  <span style="color: green;">two</span>  or three  <span style="color: green;">large</span>  scales in C. stejnegeri and C. lannomi)| <span style="color: red;">intersupraoculars</span>  relatively small, <span style="color: green;">5</span> (somewhat smaller, 6–8, rarely  <span style="color: green;">5</span>  in C. stejnegeri| <span style="color: green;">large</span>  and flat, <span style="color: green;">4</span>  in C. lannomi)| first pair of  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span>  <span style="color: green;">mostly separated</span>  by the mental (in broad contact in C. stejnegeri and C. lannomi)| the second pair of  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span>  in broad contact with chin-shields (often excluded or in narrow contact in C. stejnegeri)| <span style="color: red;">ventrals</span>  <span style="color: green;">172</span>  in single male ( <span style="color: green;">172</span> –178 in male C. stejnegeri)| <span style="color: red;">subcaudals</span>  <span style="color: green;">41</span> (42–45 in male C. stejnegeri)| hemipenis with spines on proximal portion of lobes grading abruptly to calyces and  <span style="color: green;">large</span>  ridged calyces covering apex of each lobe (spines gradually grading to calyces and distal portion of lobe smooth in C. stejnegeri). The type of C. ericsmithi has a longer tail (15.9% of TL) and proportionally smaller rattle (proximal segment  <span style="color: green;">2.2 mm</span> ) than any known species of rattlesnake. In C. lannomi the  <span style="color: red;">dorsal head and body markings</span>  appear to be slightly more  <span style="color: green;">boldly outlined</span>  in black than the other  <span style="color: green;">two</span>  species of long-tailed rattlesnakes and the dark lower border of the  <span style="color: red;">postocular stripe</span>  continues beneath and in front of the eye to merge with the dark border of the snout blotch| the  <span style="color: red;">postocular stripe</span>  <span style="color: green;">reaches the rictus</span>  whereas it is separated from the rictus by the ultimate supralabial in C. ericsmithi.

<i>intersupraoculars: central, with tendency to the increase or coalesce</i><br>
<br>
Bothrops mattogrossensis	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis - Uniform pigmentation in all the supralabials or big dark markings (covering more than 50% of the supralabial surface) more conspicuous in supralabials of the anterior half of the mouth. When these spots are present, the largest always meet under the eye. Dorsolateral blotches of the body with well defined contours, standing out from the ground coloration. Usually the last dorsolateral blotches of the trunk are divided vertically to the middle. Postcephalic stripes usually absent. When present, never with length larger than occipital length spots. Without melanism in the head. Postocular stripes well defined and keels always with the same coloration of the dorsal scales. Blotches in the interspaces between two consecutive blotches are present. Dorsolateral blotches in the trunk of variable formats from 16 to 33 (modes 21 and 22).<br>
<br>
Bothrops pauloensis	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: Postocular stripe well marked, which frequently expands around the labial fissure, developing a melanism on the sides of head. All the supralabials with uniform pigmentation, without conspicuous spots. Oblique occipital blotches rarely surpass quadratemandibular articulation, consequently postcephalic stripes are absent. Borders of the dorsolateral blotches with variable contour: diffuse or well marked. Blotches between two consecutive dorsolateral blotches usually absent. Keels with the same coloration of the dorsal scales. Ground coloration extremely varied, but the cream tone with the black dorsolateral blotches are more common. Dorsolateral blotches of the trunk from 11 to 25 (modes 15 and 17) with variable formats and relatively distant from each other.<br>
<i>dorsolateral blotches of the trunk: 11-25</i><br>
<br>
Bothrops pubescens	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis - More than half or all the clear supralabials with dark markings (covering less than 50% of the supralabial surface) not very intense triangular format always in the suture between two supralabials. Dorsolateral blotches of well-defined contour, outstanding grayground coloration, still more for the presence of white margins in the principal parts of the dorsolateral blotches. Short postcephalic stripes can be present. Pair of occipital blotches with different formats, but the arrangement usually resembles two opposed arrows pointing to the head sides (“< >”). Melanism in the head absent. Postocular stripe very marked and keels always with the same coloration of the dorsal scales. Dorsolateral blotches in the trunk from 19 to 30 (mode 21) with triangular to trapezoid format and relatively close to each other.<br>
<br>
Bothrops marmoratus	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis – The new species is distinguished from the 22 species of Bothrops by having a  <span style="color: red;">prelacunal</span>  not fused to the second supralabial (list in Campbell and Lamar 2004). On the other hand, it shares with fourteen other Bothrops species, the  <span style="color: red;">prelacunal</span>  separated from the second supralabial. Of these fourteen species of Bothrops, eight do not belong to the complex B. neuwiedi. B. marmoratus is distinguished from B. alternatus by having  <span style="color: green;">5–9</span>  <span style="color: red;">intersupraoculars</span> (vs. 8–13), 21–26  <span style="color: red;">midbody dorsal scale rows</span> (vs. usually 27–33 in B. alternatus), and by lacking a distinctive dorsal pattern of bold, headphone-shaped markings. It differs from B. ammodytoides by not having a canthus rostralis that is characteristically curved upward, and a distinctly raised snout. Bothrops marmoratus differs from B. cotiara and B. fonsecai by not showing conspicuous dark brown occipital stripes extending forward to the snout where they converge, forming a distinctive spear-shaped mark on the top of the head, as well as by having a  <span style="color: red;">venter</span>  <span style="color: green;">brighter</span>  than these two species. It differs from B. erythromelas by having higher counts of  <span style="color: red;">midbody dorsal scale rows</span>  <span style="color: red;">ventrals</span>  and  <span style="color: red;">subcaudals</span> ( <span style="color: green;">19–21</span>  <span style="color: green;">139–158</span>  and  <span style="color: green;">32–42</span>  in B. erythromelas respectively). It can be distinguished from B. itapetiningae by the higher number of  <span style="color: red;">ventrals</span>  and  <span style="color: red;">subcaudals</span> (157182, and 32-50 in B. marmoratus vs. 144–160, and 26–38 in B. itapetiningae), from B. jonathani by having 21-26  <span style="color: red;">midbody dorsal scale rows</span> (vs. 30-33), and from Bothrops pictus by not showing dorsal  <span style="color: red;">blotches</span>  arranged mostly on the middorsum, fusing into a zigzag stripe (Campbell and Lamar 2004).The other six remaining Bothrops species, together with B. marmoratus, belong to the B. neuwiedi complex. In general, they have 4-12  <span style="color: red;">intersupraoculars</span>  1-2 rows of small scales between the subocular and fourth supralabial, <span style="color: red;">prelacunal</span>  separated from second supralabial, <span style="color: green;">710</span>  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span> (usually 8-9) <span style="color: green;">9-13</span>  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span> (usually 10-11), 21-29  <span style="color: red;">midbody dorsal scale rows</span>  157-187  <span style="color: red;">ventrals</span>  in males, 158-189  <span style="color: red;">ventrals</span>  in females, 39-61 divided  <span style="color: red;">subcaudals</span>  in males, 34-55 in females| often the top of the head with a blotch between the canthals, one pair close to supraoculars, and another pair in the occipital-temporal region| triangular to trapezoidal dorsolateral  <span style="color: red;">blotches</span>  that alternate or are opposite one another mid-dorsally| between two consecutive dorsolateral  <span style="color: red;">blotches</span>  there may or may not be one spot or blotch| the base of each dorsolateral blotch has a pair of oval or round  <span style="color: red;">blotches</span>  that tend to form a lateral series of  <span style="color: red;">blotches</span>  typical in the complex| a series of brown or gray paraventral spots may be present| <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span>  with some type of ornamentation in color| bronze or bright gold iris, dark pinkish gray tongue| white tail tip in juveniles| white or yellow  <span style="color: red;">venter</span>  with gray specks scattered throughout, that may form transverse markings throughout the scale sutures| lobes of hemipenis are moderately attenuated, with 28-35 medium to large spines in each one (Campbell and Lamar 2004). Therefore, Bothrops marmoratus may be distinguished from other species of the B. neuwiedi complex mainly through qualitative characteristics (Table 1, Figure 1 in DA SILVA & RODRIGUES 2008). Bothrops lutzi has dark brown or brown  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span>  with small vertically elongated white  <span style="color: red;">blotches</span>  more conspicuous on the posterior half of the mouth, and white keels in many dorsal scales (Figure 1A). Bothrops neuwiedi has dorsolateral  <span style="color: red;">blotches</span>  with well-defined, white-edged borders, short postcephalic stripes| most  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span>  black or dark brown with large, round white  <span style="color: red;">blotches</span> (Figure 1B). Bothrops pauloensis has a melanic head, <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span>  not finely stippled| posteriormost pair of occipital  <span style="color: red;">blotches</span>  generally ellipsoidal (Figure 1C). Bothrops mattogrossensis has dorsolateral  <span style="color: red;">blotches</span>  with well-defined borders, <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span>  generally creamish-white with large dark brown  <span style="color: red;">blotches</span>  that cover most of the  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span>  from the anterior half of the mouth| largest blotch is beneath the eye (Figure 1E). Bothrops diporus has postcephalic stripes (much) larger than the occipital  <span style="color: red;">blotches</span> | <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span>  generally creamish-white with large dark brown  <span style="color: red;">blotches</span>  that cover most of  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span>  throughout the anterior half of the mouth| largest blotch directly under the eye (Figure 1F). In Bothrops pubescens more than half to all  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span>  creamish-white with small, triangular dark  <span style="color: red;">blotches</span> (covering less than half of the supralabial surface)| dark  <span style="color: red;">blotches</span>  not very conspicuous, lying throughout the suture between two  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span> (Figure 1G).<br>

Metlapilcoatlus indomitus	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis (from abstract): The new species is easily distinguished from all other members of the genus, except A. picadoi from Costa Rica and Panama, by possessing more ventral scales ( <span style="color: green;">140</span>  vs. 3–138). This new species differs from A. picadoi in being relatively small, less than 600 mm in total length (vs. reaching > 750 mm), having the posterior third of the body venter heavily melanized (vs. more than 50%), less than 50% of the underside of the tail melanized, and the postorbital stripe covering more than 50% of only one or two scales from the first temporal row and covering completely only the last scale of the row, at most (vs. 3–4 more than 50% melanized and the last two scales in the row usually completely melanized). In addition to morphological characters, molecular evidence also differentiates this new species from the other species of Atropoides (as recognized by Castoe et al. 2005). Using mitochondrial gene sequence data, they found the new species described herein to represent the sister species of A. occiduus, with  <span style="color: green;">5</span> .7 % sequence divergence separating these two taxa.Diagnosis (from main text): A relatively small terrestrial pitviper (female and male 549 and 573 mm TL, respectively) in which the tail comprises 13.7% of the TL in the single known male and .9% in the single known female. There are 0–1 nasorostrals, 8– intersupraoculars that are distinctly keeled, 23–24 interrictals that are also keeled, –11 supralabials, 11–12 infralabials, <span style="color: green;">140</span>  <span style="color: red;">ventrals</span>  37–41 subcaudals (first divided), 24–25 dorsal scale rows at midbody, 26–32 lateral body blotches, and  <span style="color: green;">5</span> –6 tail blotches.Atropoides indomitus can be distinguished from all other known species of Atropoides, except A. picadoi from Costa Rica and adjacent Panama, by having more ventral scales, <span style="color: green;">140</span>  compared to a maximum of 130, 136, 135, and 116 in males, and 135, 138, 137, and 119 in females of A. mexicanus, A. nummifer, A. occiduus, and A. olmec respectively. Additionally, A. indomitus differs from A. mexicanus, a potentially sympatric species, in having a single scale between the prelacunal and second supralabial (vs. 2 or 3), a single or no nasorostral (vs. 2–4), the rostral apex reaching the canthal ridge, and the postorbital stripe including temporal rows 2 and 3 at midlength (vs. 3 and 4| see Campbell and Lamar 2004: 276, Fig. 91). It differs from A. nummifer, occurring on the slopes of the Sierra Madre Oriental of Mexico, in having the  <span style="color: red;">postocular stripe</span>  extending up to five scales behind the rictus (vs. usually ending at the ultimate infralabial or no more than two to three scales behind the rictus), in having the anterior two thirds of the body venter nearly immaculate or just finely stippled at the midline (vs. multiple dark ventrolateral blotches extending more than 1/4 the width of the  <span style="color: red;">ventrals</span>  into the midline), and in having the underside of the tail with some dark pigment, paler towards tip and near vent (vs. nearly completely black in most specimens). Atropoides indomitus can be distinguished further from A. occiduus in having a subocular spot that does not contact the orbit of the eye (vs. contacting orbit), a postorbital stripe including only the last three temporal scales of the first row, with only the posterior one or two scales more than half pigmented (vs. covering completely or almost completely three or more temporal scales of the first row), in having the dark spot below the pit small and only encompassing the prelacunal and anterior part of the postlacunal and the edge of the contiguous foveals (vs. large and encompassing also most of the contiguous foveals and usually even part of supralabials 2 and 3), in having a high number of supralabials, –11 (vs. 8–), in having a high number of subcaudals, 37–40 (vs. 24–36, for both males and females), and in having a nearly immaculate venter or with only slight mid-ventral stippling on the anterior two thirds of the body (vs. multiple dark ventrolateral blotches extending more than 1/4 the width of the  <span style="color: red;">ventrals</span>  into the midline, a checkered pattern, or at least some heavy mottling on the anterior half of the body). The new species differs from A. olmec by possessing a rostral that reaches the canthal ridge (vs. terminating well below the ridge), one or no nasorostrals (vs. 1–3, 3 being most common), a single scale between the second supralabial and the prelacunal (vs. 2–3), and a high number of subcaudals, 37 in males and 28 in females (vs. 25–33 in males and 25–30 in females). Atropoides indomitus differs from A. picadoi in being smaller (573 mm maximum known TL vs. reaching > 750 mm [Campbell and Lamar 2004]), having 50% or more of the last third of the venter of the body pale (vs. very dark posterior third of body venter, more than 50% melanized), the underside of the tail more than 50% pale (vs. adults with all or most of the tail black), the postorbital stripe covering more than 50% in only one or two scales from the first temporal row, completely only the ultimate, at most (vs. 3–4 and the last two usually completely melanized). Atropoides indomitus has fewer ventral scales than most of its congeners, <span style="color: green;">140</span> (vs. 138-155), the female has fewer subcaudals (28 vs. 30–37), whereas the male subcaudal count of 37 overlaps only with that of A. picadoi (34–40) [SMITH et al. 2008].<br>

Vipera altaica	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: A species within the ursinii complex that differs from all other taxa in the complex by the combination of characteristics. It has a small to medium size| non-bilineate ground color| white belly| small lateral blotches and spots present| dark sutures on labials in males| dorsal zigzag band with pointed comers of windings, or with transverse bars| high number of dorsal windings| upper nasal split absent| a squarish rostral| variable loreal number| many circumoculars| upper preocular in contact with nasal| medium number of crown scales| parietals fragmented or not| nine supralabials on each side| posterior supralabials of the same size as anterior ones| fourth supralabial below orbit| ten sublabials on each side| normally four mental scales| somewhat early dorsal scale row reduction compared to renardi| 21 rows on neck and at midbody| a high ventral number| no pronounced exposed intersquamose area| a high number of subcaudals and being a foothill valleys steppe inhabitant. A low mountain species of the ursinii complex characterized by an external morphology normally evolved as typical for mountain taxa of the ursinii complex| similar to European mountain populations (ursin ii, macrops) in some characters and to renardi and Asian mountain populations (eriwanensis) in others but unique to both in combination of characters. It is special in being the smallest taxon, and having the highest number of ventrals within the entire complex| in being a lowland dweller with a color and scalation characteristics typical for mountain taxa, and in having a sharp sexual dimorphism in labial pattern and loreal number. It differs from parapatric renardi by having an earlier dorsal scale row reduction (19 - 21, mean at 90th ventral number) (21 in renardi, with mean scale reduction at 95th ventral number) and a high number of ventrals, which are whitish in color. It differs from European mountain ursinii by having a high number of supralabials. It is separated from most taxa by having partly fragmented parietals (replaced by a mean number of eight scales), banded black suture on supralabials weakly developed or absent, lateral body pattern reduced to squarish rhombic spots that are tilted, dorsal scales are pronouncedly keeled. No interparietalia.<br>

<br>
Trimeresurus cardamomensis	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: Cryptelytrops cardamomensis sp. nov. is distinguished from C. venustus, C. honsonensis and C. kanburiensis, by the absence of purple-red marking (banding on the body and blotches on the head). It is distinguished from all other Asian pitviper species which have the typical "green pitviper" colouration (uniform green dorsal colour and a lateral stripe present on the first few dorsal scale rows in one or both sexes), except other species of Cryptelytrops (including C. albolabris, C. insularis and C. septentrionalis), by the presence of a fused first supralabial and nasal scale. It can be distinguished from C. albolabris, C. insularis and C. septentrionalis primarily by the relatively larger size of the eye (most obvious in adults), the relatively wider supraoculars, and the shape of the head. The latter is more elongate–oval in C. albolabris, C. insularis and C. septentrionalis, but widens quite abruptly behind the eyes in C. cardamomensis, C. macrops s.s. and C. rubeus sp. nov. (described below) to give a characteristically triangular shaped head. Cryptelytrops cardamomensis can be distinguished from both C. macrops s.s. and C. rubeus using a combination of the following characters (for further details see Table 2). In males, C. cardamomensis tends to have more scales between the rear edges of the supraoculars (BTWSUPOC2), a relatively larger eye (DEYE), and a more prominent postocular white stripe (SCROC) than either C. macrops s.s, or C. rubeus. Furthermore, compared to C. macrops s.s, the scale reduction from 19 to 17 scale rows around the body (VS19TO17) tends to occur further away from the head, it tends to have fewer (larger) scales bordering the supralabial scales (BORSUPOC), and less keeled temporal scales (KTEMP). Compared to C. rubeus, the scale reduction from 19 to 17 scale rows around the body tends to involve higher (i.e., more dorsal) scale rows (DV19TO17)| it tends to have more keeled body scales at mid-body (BSCK), and more scales between the last supralabial and the chin shields (VENTEDGE). In females, the lateral white stripe is much more prominent (STRIPE), always involving the first two dorsal scale rows. Furthermore, it tends to cover a larger proportion of the first scale row (SCR1) than in females of C. macrops s.s. A small scale is present between the nasal scale and the scale bordering the anterior edge of the pit (NASPIT), whereas this is infrequently present in C. macrops s.s. and never present in C. rubeus. Crytpelytrops cardamomensis tends to have more (smaller) scales bordering the supralabial scales (BORSUPOC) than C. rubeus, but fewer (larger) than in C. macrops s.s. The scale reduction from 19 to 17 scale rows around the body (DV19TO17) tends to involve lower scale rows in C. cardamomensis and the fusion between the first labial and nasal scale tends to be more complete (LABNAS) and involve partial sutures on both sides of the nostril (compare Figs. 3, 5 and 7), than in either C. macrops s.s, or C. rubeus. Furthermore, compared to C. macrops s.s, , the scale reduction from 19 to 17 scale rows around the body (VS19TO17) tends to occur further away from the head, it tends to have more scales between the rear edges of the supraoculars (BTWSUPOC2), a higher number of sublabial scales (SUBLAB), and a relatively smaller eye (DEYE). Compared to C. rubeus, it has more keeled body scales at mid-body (BSCK), the scale reduction from 12 to 10 scale rows around the tail (SC12O10) also tends to occur further away from the vent, and there are a larger number of ventral scales in C. cardamomensis females than in C. rubeus females [from MALHOTRA et al. 2011].<br>
<br>
Trimeresurus rubeus	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: Cryptelytrops rubeus is distinguished from all other Asian pitviper species which have the typical "green pitviper" colouration (uniform green dorsal colour and a lateral stripe present on the first few dorsal scale rows in one or both sexes), except other species of Cryptelytrops, by the presence of a fused first supralabial and nasal scale. It can be distinguished from C. albolabris, C. insularis and C. septentrionalis primarily by the larger size of the eye (most obvious in adults), the wider supraoculars, and the shape of the head. The latter is more elongate–oval in C. albolabris, C. insularis and C. septentrionalis, but widens quite abruptly behind the eyes in C. car- damomensis, C. macrops s.s. and C. rubeus to give the latter a characteristically triangular shaped head. Cryptelytrops rubeus can be distinguished from C. cardamomensis sp.nov. (described above) using the combina- tion of the following characters (further details are given in Table 2). In males, C. rubeus tends to have fewer scales between the rear edges of the supraoculars (BTWSUPOC2), a relatively smaller eye (DEYE), and a less prominent postocular white stripe (SCROC). The scale reduction from 19 to 17 dorsal scale rows (DV19TO17) tends to involve lower scale rows, it tends to have less keeled body scales at mid-body (BSCK), and fewer scales between the last supralabial and the chin shields (VENTEDGE). In females, the scale reduction from 19 to 17 dorsal scale rows (DV19TO17) tends to involve higher scale rows in C. rubeus than in C. cardamomensis, it has a relatively shorter head (LHEAD), a small scale is never present between the nasal scale and the scale bordering the anterior edge of the pit (NASPIT), the lateral white stripe covers a larger proportion of the first dorsal scale row (SCR1), it tends to have fewer (larger) scales bordering the supralabial scales (BORSUPOC), and less keeled body scales at mid-body (BSCK). The scale reduction from 12 to 10 scale rows around the tail (SC12O10) also tends to occur closer to the vent in females of C. cardamomensis than C. rubeus and they also have relatively smaller eyes (DEYE). Compared to C. macrops s.s (Table 3), in both sexes C. rubeus has a more prominent lateral stripe with the white area covering a larger proportion of the first scale row (SCR1), less keeled body scales at mid-body (BSCK), and the scale reduction from 19 to 17 dorsal scale rows (VS19TO17) occurs further away from the head. In addi- tion, there are never any small scales present between the nasal scale and the scale bordering the anterior edge of the pit (NASPIT) in C. rubeus, while they sometimes occur in C. macrops s.s. In addition, males tend to have a less prominent postocular stripe (SCROC), fewer sublabial scales (SUBLAB), fewer scales between the rear edges of the supraocular scales (BTWSUPOC2), fewer scales between the last supralabial and the chin shields (VENT- EDGE), and less keeled temporal scales (KTEMP). In females, C. rubeus tends to have fewer ventral scales, fewer (larger) scales bordering the supraoculars (BORSUPOC), and a larger number of scales between the rear edges of the supraoculars (BTWSUPOC2) than C. macrops s.s.

Montivipera kuhrangica	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: Montivipera kuhrangica sp. nov. can be distinguished from other known taxa of the Montivipera raddei group by a combination of meristic and color-pattern characters. In meristic point of view, it can be stated that the new viper has a relatively high fragmentation and as a result high count of head scales compare to other taxa of the Montivipera raddei species group. In addition also strongly projected supraoculars. As is shown in Table 1, Montivipera kuhrangica sp. nov. has higher number of head scales than average in other known taxa, e.g., in intercanthal scales, supralabial and infralabial scales and outer circumocular scales, as well as highest number of intersupraocular rows of scales.In addition the shape of dorsal zigzag blotches in Montivipera kuhrangica sp. nov. is different than other mountain vipers. The dorsal blotches are mostly not tri- angle or rounded but instead often square-shaped. Also toward hind dorsum, there is a tendency to fusion of dorsal blotches to form a straight vertebral line in this new viper. In the Holotype this fusion only has occurred on tail and in the second specimen the fusion of the dorsal blotches can be seen in posterior third of dorsal side of body [from RAJABIZADEH et al. 2011].<br>

However, these three species are sympatric with O. undulatus throughout parts of their range but are distinguished by morphological features listed above. Additionally, M. barbouri and M. browni may be broadly sympatric with Crotalus intermedius and Crotalus ravus but are distinguished from these species by not having a rattle at the end of their tail [from JADIN et al. 2011].<br>

Echis borkini	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: Medium and large size efs with a very widened mouth| The dorsal spots have a diagonal shape, they are narrow, strongly extended under the back. (Google translated from Czech translation from Russian by Jiří Hejduk, 2006)Description of the holotype: Body length 500 mm, tail length 55 mm, Ventr. 167, <span style="color: red;">scd</span>  <span style="color: green;">31</span>  Sq. 29. The front part of the mouth is very wide. The coloring of the upper side of the body is light brown. The drawing of the head is significantly reduced: only a light spot in the back of the head and a dark ring-shaped part in the middle part of the head have been preserved. The dorsal spots are diagonal, strongly extended under the back, the lateral arcs have been preserved only in the form of small light lines. Each spot of the dorsal complex has two lateral arches flanked by a dark section. This complex has the form of a bright wide transverse stripe. The abdomen is spotless.

Cerrophidion wilsoni	Serpentes	Viperidae	Definition and diagnosis.

Cerrophidion wilsoni differs from other Cerrophidion species in normally having fewer scales that contact the  <span style="color: red;">supraoculars</span>  averaging 9 compared to 10–12 in other Cerrophidion species (Jadin 2010). Additionally, the median frontal scale of C. wilsoni is often quite  <span style="color: green;">small</span>  distinguishing it from other Cerrophidion species, and in many individuals the frontal scale is greatly reduced to the size of a normal  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  scale (Campbell & Solórzano 1992). In those individ- uals that contain a  <span style="color: green;">small</span>  <span style="color: red;">frontal plate</span>  this plate occupies an average of 36% of the distance between the  <span style="color: red;">supraoculars</span> (Campbell & Solo ́rzano 1992) [from JADIN et al. 2012].Similar species. Several other species of pitviper are sym- patric with C. wilsoni at various localities in Honduras. The palm-pitviper Bothriechis marchi is sympatric with C. wilsoni in Parque Nacional Cusuco in the Sierra de Omoa in northwestern Honduras, and C. wilsoni is sym- patric or nearly sympatric with Atropoides mexicanus and Bothrops asper along the lower edges of the cloud forest (Townsend & Wilson 2008), a situation mirrored with the same four species in Reserva de Vida Silvestre Texı ́g- uat in north-central Honduras (Townsend et al. 2012). There may also be sympatric or near-sympatric popula- tions of Bothriechis thalassinus and C. wilsoni in the vicinity of the shared border between Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. These species are easily distinguished from C. wilsoni by the following characteristics: Bothriechis species have prehensile tails, are typically slender and are mostly green, except certain colour variations in B. schlegelii. The species most closely resembling C. wilsoni are certain pop- ulations of A. indomitus and A. mexicanus but they have broader heads, more numerous distinctly tuberculate sup- racephalic scales, a narrower and longer dark postocular stripe, nasorostrals present and a much stockier body shape [from JADIN et al. 2012].<br>

Bothrops otavioi	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: The new species is similar to B. jararaca (Fig. 4A, Table 1), and is distin- guished from this latter species by the combination of characters listed below (B. jararaca in parentheses). Smaller adult size in males: range  <span style="color: red;">svl</span>  1⁄4 388–475 mm, n 1⁄4 4 (versus range  <span style="color: red;">svl</span>  1⁄4 635–1000 mm, n 1⁄4 46)| few and larger scales at the  <span style="color: red;">intersupraocular row</span> : range 1⁄4  <span style="color: green;">three–six scales</span> (versus range five–nine scales)| lower number of  <span style="color: red;">ventral scales</span>  in males: 182–190 (versus 200–211)| lower number of  <span style="color: red;">ventral scales</span>  in females: 185–192 (versus 190–218)| lower number of  <span style="color: red;">subcaudal scales</span>  in males: 54–61 (versus 62– 72)| lower number of  <span style="color: red;">anterior cephalic scales</span>  generally rounded and with no or feeble keels: range 1⁄4 20–44 (versus range 27–61, generally elongate and distinctly keeled). The hemi- penis of B. otavioi sp. nov. (Fig. 5A) has few diminutive ossified spines bordering  <span style="color: red;">calyces</span>  and they are restricted to the  <span style="color: green;">basal region</span>  of the capitulum (versus many small ossified spines reaching the medial region of the capitulum, Fig. 5B)| <span style="color: red;">intersulcar region</span>  <span style="color: green;">nude</span> (versus intrasulcar region with small ossified spines). Bothrops otavioi sp. nov. is further distinguished from B. jararaca by the absence of diminutive ossified spines from the sulcus spermaticus to the base of the  <span style="color: red;">calyces</span> From B. alcatraz, another small, island- dwelling species, B. otavioi sp. nov., can be distinguished by its lower number of inter- supraocular scales: three–six (versus six–eight scales)| higher number of  <span style="color: red;">ventral scales</span>  in males: 182–190 (versus 173–182)| higher number of  <span style="color: red;">ventral scales</span>  in females: 185–192 (versus 175–186)| higher number of  <span style="color: red;">subcaudal scales</span>  in males: 54–61 (versus 47–54)| relatively longer tail in males (ratio TL/ <span style="color: red;">svl</span>  6 SD): 0.169 6 0.010 (versus 0.161 6 0.007) and in females: 0.146 6 0.016 (versus 0.138 6 0.011)| relatively longer head in males (ratio  <span style="color: red;">hl/tr</span> ): <span style="color: green;">0.057 6 0.004</span> (versus 0.053 6 0.003) and females: 0.061 6 0.008 (versus 0.055 6 0.003). Bothrops otavioi sp. nov. is distinguished from B. insularis, a larger island-dwelling species of the B. jararaca group, mainly by its  <span style="color: green;">brownish</span>  <span style="color: red;">color pattern</span> (pale or yellowish in B. insularis), lower number of  <span style="color: red;">intersupraocular scales</span> : 3–6 (versus  <span style="color: green;">7–9</span> ), lower number of  <span style="color: red;">anterior cephalic scales</span> : 20–44 (versus  <span style="color: green;">47–64</span> ), and smaller adult size in males: <span style="color: red;">svl</span>  1⁄4 388–475 mm (versus  <span style="color: green;">393–788 mm</span> ). The new species overlaps with B. insularis in number of  <span style="color: red;">ventral scales</span> : 182–190 (versus 171–188) in males, and 185–192 (versus  <span style="color: green;">176–195</span> ) in females| and  <span style="color: red;">subcaudal scales</span> : 54–61 (versus  <span style="color: green;">55–65</span> ) in males, and 48–54 (versus 48–59) in females.Regarding haplotype genealogy, Bothrops otavioi sp. nov. is nested within the northern clade of Bothrops jararaca group sensu Grazziotin et al. (2006| Fig. 6). The new species has the most common cytb haplotype within the northern clade of B. jararaca group, sharing the same sequence with populations from Alcatrazes Island, northern Sao Paulo, and the continental coastal slope to lowlands (Fig. 6) [from BARBO et al. 2012].<br>

Crotalus ornatus	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: Crotalus ornatus (Fig. 11) can be distinguished from most congeners by having (1) a medium-sized SVL (adults 70– 100 cm, rarely to 130 cm SVL)| (2) two large, triangular internasal scales| (3) two large prefrontals| (4) two large frontal scales| ( <span style="color: green;">5</span> ) 6– 10  <span style="color: red;">prefoveals</span> | (6) <span style="color: green;">2–4</span>  <span style="color: red;">loreals</span> | (7) two preocu- lars| (8) five  <span style="color: red;">postoculars</span> | (9) <span style="color: green;">2–7</span>  intersuprao- culars| (10) <span style="color: green;">16–18</span>  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span> | (11) <span style="color: green;">14–21</span>  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span> | (12) <span style="color: green;">23–29</span>  <span style="color: red;">dorsal scale rows at midbody</span> | (13) <span style="color: green;">164–205</span>  <span style="color: red;">ventrals</span> | (14) 16–30 subcaudals (16–26 in females and 21–30 in males)| (15) <span style="color: red;">internasal–prefrontal region and supraoculars</span>  <span style="color: green;">black or dark brown</span> | (16) dark pigmentation of dorsal pattern extends from nape to occipital and parietal regions| (17) 22– 33 (mean  <span style="color: green;">5</span>  29) <span style="color: red;">rhomboid dorsal body blotches</span>  that often coalesce with lateral blotches at midbody to form bands or chevrons (dorsal blotches of some specimens may become diffuse posteriorly, represented by barely distinct or absent bands anterior to vent)| (18) <span style="color: red;">light medial spots</span>  <span style="color: green;">longer than wide on anterior portion of body</span>  becoming broader at midbody and separating dorsal blotches| (19) medial spots often become indistinguishable from ground color on posterior one-quarter of body| (20) two white or light grey, irregular paraver- tebral spots present within each dorsal blotch, usually separated by 1–6 dorsal scale rows on anterior portion of body, but darken slightly and grow to extend across midline of dorsum to fill interior of dorsal blotches on posterior half of body| (21) tail  <span style="color: green;">black or dark brown</span>  with faint crossbands sometimes visible| (22) proximal rattle segment  <span style="color: green;">black or dark brown</span> (Tables 6–7| from ANDERSON & GREENBAUM 2012).Comparisons.—Crotalus ornatus is unique among C. molossus lineages in having 4–11  <span style="color: red;">prefoveals</span> | <span style="color: green;">2–7</span>  <span style="color: red;">loreals</span> | a ground color of gray, olive-green, olive-brown, or tan| <span style="color: green;">22–33</span>  rhom- bic dorsal blotches, each separated by a light gray, white, or pale yellow medial spot| and anterior  <span style="color: green;">6–10</span>  dorsal blotches connected by 1–3 scale rows, often resembling paravertebral stripes or a thick dorsal stripe surrounding  <span style="color: red;">light medial spots</span>  Crotalus ornatus most closely resembles C. molossus sensu stricto, but can be distinguished from the latter taxon by its lower average scale counts (P = 0.001) for  <span style="color: red;">prefoveals</span> (8 vs. 10) and  <span style="color: red;">loreals</span> (3 vs. 4), fewer dorsal blotches (29 vs. 32), and a dorsal blotch pattern where the first  <span style="color: green;">6–10</span>  dorsal blotches are almost always connected (dorsal blotches are almost always separated by a light medial spot in C. molossus sensu stricto). Crotalus ornatus can be distinguished from C. m. nigrescens and C. m. oaxacus by having a higher number of dorsal scale rows at mid- body (27 vs. 25)| a higher number of  <span style="color: red;">ventrals</span> (up to 205 in females vs. 187 in C. m. nigrescens and fewer in C. m. oaxacus| Klauber, 1972)| dark pigmentation on the head restricted to the internasal–prefrontal area, with thin (1 scale row wide), sometimes ornate lines on the occipital and parietal regions (extensive pig- mentation often covers most of the head of the latter two lineages)| and light medial and paravertebral spots in the dorsal pattern (usually absent in the latter two taxa). In C. m. oaxacus, it is common for adults to retain black and white tail rings that are typical in juveniles of the C. molossus group (Campbell and Lamar, 1989, 2004), but this character does not persist to adulthood in C. ornatus.Crotalus ornatus is most easily distin- guished from C. estebanensis by geographic distribution| the former is widespread throughout most of the Chihuahuan Desert, whereas the latter is an insular endemic in the Gulf of California. Morphologically, C. orna- tus differs from C. estebanensis in having relatively dark dorsal blotches that boldly contrast with the ground color (dorsal blotch- es are paler and the pattern is moderately contrasting with the ground color in C. estebanensis), and dark pigmentation on the head in the internasal-prefrontal area (absent in C. estebanensis| Grismer, 1999| Campbell and Lamar, 2004). Klauber (1949) noted longitudinal and transverse compression of the rattle of C. estebanensis, which is a unique character among members of the C. molossus group, including C. ornatus.Crotalus ornatus differs from C. totonacus in being smaller (rarely to 130 cm vs. commonly exceeding 150 cm)| in having a larger number of  <span style="color: red;">intersupraoculars</span> ( <span style="color: green;">5</span>  vs. 1 or 2) <span style="color: red;">prefoveals</span> (8 vs. 3 or 4) <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span> (17 vs.14), and  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span> (17 vs. 15)| in having an anterior dorsal pattern of interconnected but usually distinct dorsal blotches (paravertebral stripes [usually without distinct blotches] on the neck transition into an intricate pattern on the head in C. totonacus)| and by the lack of a vertebral ridge (relatively well-developed in C. totonacus| Campbell and Lamar, 2004, Anderson & Greenbaum 2012).<br>

Vipera anatolica	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis (senliki): A small viper ( <span style="color: red;">svl</span> <span style="color: green;">< 40 cm</span>  <span style="color: red;">tail length</span> <span style="color: green;">< 6 cm</span> ) closely related and resembling to the Anatolian meadow (mountain steppe) viper Vipera anatolica Eiselt and Baran, 1970. Based on 19 Vipera a. senliki ssp. nov. from Mühür Daǧ and 7 Vipera a. anatolica from Kohu Daǧ (increased to 14 concerning colour pattern characters only, see Material and methods), Vipera a. senliki ssp. nov. differs from the nominotypic subspecies by: (1) significantly more anterior  <span style="color: red;">dorsal scale rows</span>  with mostly (90%) <span style="color: green;">21</span>  <span style="color: red;">dorsal scale rows</span>  behind the head (vs. 18 or 19 rows in V. a. anatolica)| (2) higher  <span style="color: red;">ventral scales count</span>  with a mean of  <span style="color: green;">122.11</span> (vs. 118.27 in V. a. anatolica)| (3) smaller number of  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span>  with mostly  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">9</span> </span>  scales (vs. 10 in V. a. anatolica)| ( <span style="color: green;">4</span> ) fewer  <span style="color: red;">circumoculars</span>  with mostly  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">9</span> </span>  scales (vs. mostly 10 in V. a. anatolica)| (5) fewer  <span style="color: red;">loreals</span>  with mostly  <span style="color: green;">4</span>  scales (vs. mostly 5 in V. a. anatolica)| (6) a relatively wider head, i.e. <span style="color: green;">lower</span> ‘ <span style="color: red;">head length/head width</span> ’ ratio (7) showing a higher number of interruptions of the mid-dorsal zig-zag band (NIZB) between the head and the dorsal position of the anal plate, with 5- 22 interblotch-spaces lacking any clear dorsal-band connection (vs. 0- <span style="color: green;">4</span>  inter- ruptions in V. a. anatolica). Interruptions are defined as the lack of dark dor- sal colour (brownish to blackish) visibly connecting two mid-dorsal blotches, but not counting scales with only very light suffusion by speckling or with dark colour only along the edges of those scales or adjacent interscalar skin| (8) showing a remarkable  <span style="color: green;">reddish</span>  colouration of  <span style="color: red;">subcaudals</span> (CSC) in 90% of females and 40% of males (vs. none or light brownish in the two female and five males of V. a. anatolica).

Ovophis convictus	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: larger third than fourth supralabial, paired subcaudals, distinguished from other species sharing these character states by particularly low ventral (120–139) and subcaudal scale counts. [MALHOTRA et al. 2011, Appendix G]<br>
<br>
Crotalus armstrongi	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: Crotalus triseriatus armstrongi can be distinguished by its pale gray, reddish brown, brownish yellow, or yellowish green ground color from C. t. triseriatus which has a dark gray or dark grayish brown dorsum. In C. t. armstrongi the body blotches tend to be as wide orwider than long while in C. t. triseriatus the blotches are usualIy Ionger than wide. Crotalus t. armstrongi further differs from C. t. triseriatus in that males (N=3) generally have fewer  <span style="color: red;">ventrals</span>  and  <span style="color: red;">subcaudals</span>  <span style="color: green;">130-138</span> (134.3) and  <span style="color: green;">24-26</span> (25.3), respectively, as compared to 136-151 (144.0) and 26-34 (29.2), respectively. Crotalus t. armstrongi can be distinguished from C. t. aquilus by having a distinct postocular stripe, a proportionally smaller rattle, and in males possessing fewer  <span style="color: red;">ventrals</span> (the number usually exceeding 145 in C. t. aqutlus). Crotalus t. armstrongi females (N= 6) generally have fewer  <span style="color: red;">ventrals</span>  138-146 (142.0), and more  <span style="color: red;">subcaudals</span>  22-25 (23.5) than female C. t. aquilus which have 143-160 (151.7) <span style="color: red;">ventrals</span>  and 17-23 (20.4) <span style="color: red;">subcaudals</span>  The only other rattlesnake with which C. t. armstrongi may be confused is C. pusillus, but it may be easily distinguished from this form by its having fewer  <span style="color: red;">ventrals</span>  and  <span style="color: red;">subcaudals</span> ,fewer pterygoid teeth, and canthals that fall to make contact with each other (Campbell 1979: 366).<br>
<br>
Crotalus tlaloci	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: Crotalus tlaloci can be distinguished from all members of the C. triseriatus species group by the combination of the following characters: (1) presence of  <span style="color: red;">intercanthals</span>  (2) undivided upper preocular, (3) 152–164 ventrals in males, 156–165 in females, (4) 27–33 subcaudals in males, 22–32 in females, (5) small  <span style="color: red;">rattle</span> (proximal  <span style="color: red;">rattle</span>  width 11.1–14.5% of head length), (6) long  <span style="color: red;">tail</span> ( <span style="color: green;">8.9–11.3% of total body length</span>  in males, 8.0–10.7% in females), (7) usually  <span style="color: green;">two pairs of symmetrical, similarly sized</span>  <span style="color: red;">intercanthals</span>  and (8) dark  <span style="color: red;">postocular stripe</span>  that  <span style="color: green;">noticeably narrows before reaching the posterior of the eye</span> Crotalus tlaloci is most similar to species of the C. triseriatus group distributed along the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. Crotalus tlaloci is distinguished from these species by the presence of  <span style="color: red;">intercanthals</span> (lacking in C. pusillus), undivided upper preocular (divided 14.3% of the time in C. armstrongi and 9.4% of the time in C. triseriatus), high number of ventrals (overlapping with C. pusillus, but mean number in C. tlaloci higher than C. pusillus: 156 vs. 154, respectively), high number of subcaudals (mean number in females higher than in C. pusillus, C. armstrongi, and C. triseriatus: 28 vs. 26, 24, and 24| in males, higher than in C. armstrongi and C. triseriatus: 30 vs. 28 in both), proportionately small proximal  <span style="color: red;">rattle</span> (mean width smaller than in C. armstrongi and C. triseriatus: 12.8% of head length vs. 14.0% and 15.8%), and proportionately longer  <span style="color: red;">tail</span> (mean length in females higher than in C. pusillus, C. armstrongi, and C. triseriatus: 9.2% of total length vs. 8.6%, 8.3%, and 8.3%). Most specimens (10/12) possess  <span style="color: green;">two pairs of symmetrical, similarly sized</span>  <span style="color: red;">intercanthals</span>  creating the appearance of butterfly wings. Of the 100 specimens in the C. triseriatus group that we examined, this symmetrical paired arrangement of intercanthal scales in the prefrontal region (“butterfly wings”) was observed in only one other specimen (C. armstrongi, CNAR 4498). Crotalus tlaloci also possess a dark  <span style="color: red;">postocular stripe</span>  that  <span style="color: green;">noticeably narrows before reaching the posterior of the eye</span>  In C. pusillus, C. armstrongi, and C. triseriatus, the  <span style="color: red;">postocular stripe</span>  is generally of uniform width, although on rare occasions in C. pusillus and C. armstrongi it tapers slightly before reaching the eye.<br>

Crotalus campbelli	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: Crotalus campbelli can be distinguished from all members of the C. triseriatus species group except C. armstrongi by the combination of the following characters: (1) presence of intercanthals, (2) infrequently divided upper preocular (9.1% of the time), (3) 150–154 ventrals in males, 147–152 in females, (4) 31–32 subcaudals in males, 22–26 in females, (5) small  <span style="color: red;">rattle</span> (proximal  <span style="color: red;">rattle</span>  width 11.0–14.6% of head length), (6) long  <span style="color: red;">tail</span> ( <span style="color: green;">9.1–11.0% of total body length in males, 7.5–8.9% in females</span> ), (7) <span style="color: green;">pale interspaces</span>  between  <span style="color: red;">dorsal and lateral blotches</span>  (8) heavy venter mottling, (9) <span style="color: green;">dark</span>  <span style="color: red;">proximal  <span style="color: red;">rattle</span>  and underside of  <span style="color: red;">tail</span> </span>  and (10) usually a  <span style="color: green;">single large</span>  <span style="color: red;">anterior intercanthal</span>  Crotalus campbelli can be distinguished from C. armstrongi based on higher mean number of ventrals (152 in males and 149 in females vs. 141 and 144), higher mean number of subcaudals in males (31 vs. 28), less frequently divided upper preocular (9.1% vs. 14.3%), proportionately longer  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  in males (10.3% of total body length vs. 9.7%), smaller mean proximal  <span style="color: red;">rattle</span>  width (13.0% of head length vs. 14.0%), higher mean number of dorsal blotches (48 vs. 42), and higher number of  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  bands (mode of 9 vs. 6).Crotalus campbelli is most similar to members of the C. triseriatus group distributed along the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, including C. pusillus, C. armstrongi, C. triseriatus, and C. tlaloci. Crotalus campbelli is distinguished from C. pusillus by possessing intercanthals and an infrequently divided upper preocular, from C. tlaloci by having an infrequently divided upper preocular, variable number of intercanthals, fewer ventrals (in females, 147–152 vs. 156–165| in males, mean number 152 vs. 156), lower mean number of subcaudals in females (24 vs. 28), proportionately shorter  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  in females (8.2% of total length vs. 9.2%), and higher mean number of dorsal blotches (48 vs. 43), and from C. triseriatus by a higher number of ventrals (in males, 150–154 vs. 134–146| in females, mean number higher: 149 vs. 142), higher mean number of subcaudals in males (31 vs. 28), proportionately smaller proximal  <span style="color: red;">rattle</span> (13.0% of head length vs. 15.8%), and by having  <span style="color: green;">pale interspaces</span>  between  <span style="color: red;">dorsal and lateral blotches</span>  Crotalus campbelli is most similar in general appearance to C. armstrongi, but can be distinguished from this species by characters mentioned above. Half of the specimens of C. campbelli also possess a single, large  <span style="color: red;">anterior intercanthal</span>  This scale arrangement is rarely seen in C. armstrongi and C. triseriatus. Crotalus campbelli is easily distinguished from C. ravus by the lack of large head plates in the parietal region.<br>

<br>
Ophryacus smaragdinus	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: Ophryacus smaragdinus can be distinguished from all other pitvipers in North America by the combination of the following characters: absence of a rattle| divided subcaudal scales| presence of a supraocular horn that is not in immediate contact with the eye| fewer than 30 interrictal scales| and usually fewer than 10 supralabials on each side of the head (Fig. 2). A distinctive white, cream, or pale yellow triangular marking is present on the lateral surfaces of the head, starting just below the suboculars and extending diagonally onto the 5th and 6th supralabials| this pale marking often extends onto the 7th and 8th (if present) supralabials. Secondary pale markings also are present on the 1st and 3rd supralabials, whereas the color of the 2nd and 4th supralabials is the same as the  ground color of the head. This pale-colored triangular marking and the associated secondary pale markings are diagnostic for this species, and when viewing photographic material are helpful in distinguishing it from its congeners (Fig. 9A, B, C in Grünwald et al. 2015).Comparisons: Ophryacus smaragdinus is morphologically similar to O. undulatus and species of the genus Mixcoatlus, including M. melanurus, M. browni, and, to a lesser degree, M. barbouri. Ophryacus smaragdinus can be distinguished from O. undulatus by the presence of a supraocular horn that is separated from the eye by one or two rows of small supraocular scales (Figs. 2A, 9A, B, C), as well as by the presence of fewer supralabials (often seven or eight on at least one side, but no more than 10), whereas in O. undulatus usually 11 or more are present on each side, but no fewer than nine. In O. smaragdinus 1–4 postrostral internasals are present, followed by a row of 5–7 anterior intercanthals, all of which are small and distinctly keeled. In contrast, 2–3 postrostral internasals are present in O. undulatus, which lack a keel and are followed by a row of 5–7 anterior intercanthals, of which the outer ones are large and flat and the smaller inner scales are slightly keeled. In O. smaragdinus 22–29 interrictals are present, whereas in O. undulatus there are 31–36. The upper preocular in O. smaragdinus is shorter than in O. undulatus, with a length of 25–50% of the eye diameter, compared to 70% or more in the latter species (Figs. 9, 10). The condition of the canthals also differs in the two species| whereas they might be prominent in both, the canthals of O. smaragdinus are rounded and slightly elevated, but those in O. undulatus are pointed and raised into horns (Figs. 9, 10). Finally, although the coloration of both species is variable, individuals of O. smaragdinus can be distinguished from those of O. undulatus by the presence of a white, cream, or pale yellow triangular marking that extends from the posterior portion of the eye diagonally onto the 5th and 6th supralabials. This triangular marking is not present in O. undulatus (Figs. 4, 9). See Table 1 here and below for a comparison of the distinctive characters among the various species.Ophryacus smaragdinus can be distinguished from O. undulatus from the Pacific versant of the Sierra Madre del Sur, Oaxaca (Ophryacus sphenophrys new comb.| see below) by the presence of a supraocular horn that is not in immediate contact with the eye, and which is taller than wide (Fig. 2). In O. undulatus from the Pacific versant of the Sierra Madre del Sur, Oaxaca, the horn is wider than tall and in contact with the eye (Figs. 6A| 10C, D). Furthermore, four characters also are useful in distinguishing the two species. Values for O. undulatus from the Pacific versant of the Sierra Madre del Sur, Oaxaca follow those for O. smaragdinus: a shorter tail in males (less than 15% of SVL, compared to over 17%), fewer supralabials (usually 7–9, vs. 10), fewer interrictals (22–29, as opposed to 33), and fewer subcaudals (39–46, as opposed to 51–57). Ophryacus smaragdinus can be distinguished from M. melanurus by the presence of divided subcaudals, a supraocular horn that is separated from the eye by one or two rows of small supraoculars, and fewer supralabials (7–9 vs. 10–14 in M. melanurus). Furthermore, M. melanurus is gray and not green, whereas O. smaragdinus is green or brown and not gray (Fig. 4). Ophryacus smaragdinus can be distinguished from the other two species of Mixcoatlus by the presence of supraocular horns, as well as by the number of intersupraoculars (11 in O. smaragdinus vs. 1 in M. browni and 3–4 in M. barbouri (Figs. 9, 10). Additionally, in O. smaragdinus one or two scales are present between the subocular and the supralabials, whereas in M. browni and M. barbouri the suboculars are in contact with the supralabials (Figs. 9, 10).<br>

Head fat, much wider than neck| dorsal head scales with a low keel, those at sides with a protuberant keel| six scales from rostral to supraocular, next to canthal ridge| two small internasals bordering nasals laterally, rostral anteriorly and each other medially| a protuberant supranasal, as large as internasals| four scales conacting internasals posteriorly between supranasals| posterior to this row, another row of six scales, slightly larger than any other on snout, between canthals| two canthal scales between nasal and preocular| a large upper and a small lower preocular above meatus putealis| nasal large, in contact with supranasal and first labial, divided below nostril, separated from anterior pit scale by four or five very small scales| three scales bordering pit, anterior very large and in contact with first and second labials| rear ventral pit scale in contact with second and third labials| upper rear pit scale bordering both preoculars and both canthals| one small superciliary (or cantal) dorsal to preocular, bordering large supraocular posteriorly| base of latter scale, at attachment to head, as long (3 mm.) as eye, but placed somewhat forward of center of eye| 1-2 scales bordering eye above, posterior to supraocular| supraocular projecting half its basal length (1.5 mm.) over eye| two rows of scales between eye and labials, the scales in lower row as large as second supralabial, 2-3 very small scales scattered between rows| lower row of temporals as large as or larger than supralabials, heavily keeled| temporal scales becoming gradually smaller and less heavily keeled dorsad, in about five rows| parietals decreasing in size mediad, about ½ to ⅓ size of scales on top of snout back as far as rear interorbital level| ten scales (in least count, obtainable via several rows) across top of head between supraocular horns| supralabials 10-? (several fused below eye on one side), second smallest| a sharp indentation (possibly an artifact) in anterior part of upper lip, apex at suture between first and second supralabials| 14-14 infralabials, first in contact medially, first three in contact with chinshields| one pair of chinshields, reaching level of rear edge of fifth infralabial. Scale rows 21-21-15| 171 ventrals| anal entire| 57 caudals, all divided. Total length 461 mm., tail 75 mm. Pattern of two rows of small elongate rectangles on each side of body, the rhombs of the dorsal row in some areas staggered, in others coincident and fused (see plate)| light areas at sides of body between blotches pinkish| dark markings a brownish gray, whole snake of pastel appearance, not intensely colored. Venter moderately pigmented| encroaching on edges of ventrals a series of distinct, incompletely darkedged, oval light spots, each covering the area of about three lateral scales and extending onto second scale row, one placed at about every sixth ventral| subcaudal surface somewhat darker than belly| throat lighter than rest of venter| four or five dark marks in a row along lower labium.” (Smith 1960)Comparisons. Bothrops undulatus is most closely similar to sphenophrys| no other species could be confused with it. Differences between the two are numerous. Most conspicuous is the shape of the supraocular horn. In undulatus the horn is slender, elongate, and cylindrical, like a pinfeather, with a diameter at base one third to one half its projecting length. In sphenophrys the horn is large, wedgeshaped, its diameter at base twice its projecting length and almost the length of eye. The scales on top of head in undulatus are relatively small| three postrostral internasals (not 2)| five to six scales in row behind internasals (not 4)| 13-15 scales (least possible count) between horns (not 10)| 3-4 rows of scales between eye and labials (not 2)| one row of scales between pit border scale and labials (not 0)| ventrals 149-166 except type with (?) 171 (171 in sole known sphenophrys) | caudals 41-49 (not 57). The existence of pattern differences is uncertain. Specimens at hand of undulatus (3) are extremely darkly pigmented above, showing dim evidence under fluid of median rhombs here and there fused and split so as to form a strongly undulant median stripe| the single juvenile has oval light spots along sides of body much as in sphenophrys. The belly and subcaudal surface likewise are more darkly pigmented than in sphenophrys. More specimens are necessary to provide confidence in the constancy of the vague differences now suggested in color and pattern. Although I have not re-examined the type of undulatus, the figure of the head of the type given by Jan (1859, Prodrome Icon. Gen., pl. E) clearly shows the very distinctive, slender, protuberant supraocular horn characteristic of the species with which the name undulatus has been associated in subsequent literature, including the present paper.” (Smith 1960)<br>

Body, excluding the tail, with  <span style="color: green;">26-29</span>  transverse crossbands, not extending to the sides of the body.Comparisons: The new species is distinct to all other species of the genus in the combination of the following characters: a slightly lower number of scale rows around midbody (20-22 versus mainly 23, sometimes 21)| a low number of transverse body cross-bands ( <span style="color: green;">26-29</span>  versus above 30 in all taxa beside G. himalayanus and the G. blomhoffii complex), the mean number of  <span style="color: red;">ventral scales</span> (150 which is higher than in most of the G. blomhoffi taxa, but distinctly lower than in the G. halys-intermedius complex)| and its small size (479 mm total length versus more than 600 mm is most species, apart from G. b. dubitatus, G. b. ussuriensis, G. h. halys and G. h. caucasicus which are about the same maximum total length, and G. monticola and G. strauchi which are smaller). In details, the new species is distinct to taxa of the Gloydius blomhoffi complex generally by the lack of apical scale pits, but as well by having a higher number of  <span style="color: red;">ventral scales</span> (mean 150 versus 140.7 in G. b. blomhoffii, 140.1 in G. b. dubitatus, 141.1 in G. b. brevicaudus, and 140.1 in G. b. siniticus| but apart from G. ussuriensis with 151.2)| in having a lower number of  <span style="color: red;">infralabial scales</span> (mean 8.5 versus 10.4 in G. b. blomhoffii, 10.0 in G. b. du- bitatus, 10.0 in G. b. brevicaudus, 10.1 in G. b. siniticus, and 9.8 in G. ussuriensis)| in having a higher or somewhat equal number of cross-bands on the body (mean 27.5 versus 19.9 in G. b. blomhoffii, 29.9 in G. b. dubitatus, 29.9 in G. b. brevicaudus, 30.1 in G. b. siniticus, and 28.7 in G. ussuriensis)| and by having a very indistinct coloration of crossbands versus very distinct crossbands in this complex. The new species is distinct to taxa of the Gloydius intermedius complex (according to the concept of Gloyd and Conant, 1990) by the absence of apical scale pits| in having a lower number of scale rows around midbody (mean 21 ver- sus 22.8 in G. intermedius and G. saxatilis)| in having a lower number of  <span style="color: red;">ventral scales</span> (mean 150 versus 158.5 in G. intermedius and 156.8 in G. saxatilis)| and a lower number of  <span style="color: red;">body crossbands</span> (mean 27.5 versus 36.9 in G. intermedius and 38.7 in G. saxatilis). Furthermore, the new species is distinct to all taxa of the Gloydius halys complex in having a lower number of scale rows around midbody (20-22 [mean = 21] versus usually 23 rarely 21 or 25), and very narrow indistinct crossbars along the body not extending to the lateral sides (versus distinct cross-bars and extending to the flanks in most taxa) (see table 2). The new species is distinct to G. h. halys by a lower number of  <span style="color: red;">ventral scales</span> (143- 156, mean 150 versus 164-178, mean 172)| by a lower number of  <span style="color: red;">infralabial scales</span> (mean 8.5 versus 10.7)| a lower number of body cross- bands (mean 27.5 versus 38.4)| and a distinct coloration ( <span style="color: red;">body crossbands</span>  not extending to the flanks versus extending to the flanks). The new species is distinct to G. h. boehmei by its higher number of  <span style="color: red;">subcaudal scales</span> ( <span style="color: green;">35-45</span>  ver- sus 35)| its lower number of  <span style="color: red;">infralabial scales</span> (mean 8.5 versus 11)| and a lower number of  <span style="color: red;">body crossbands</span> (mean 27.5 versus 41).

Bitis harenna	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: A Bitis of the subgenus Macrocerastes (sensu Lenk et al. 1999) that differs from all other species except B. parviocula in lacking horns between the nostrils, in having less than four scales between the rostral and first supralabial, and in having a pale cross bar on the dorsal surface of the head behind the eyes (Figs. 1, 2). Differs from all other species of the subgenus Macrocerastes (including B. parviocula) in having a concavity on the lateral wall of the braincase for the origin of the M. retractor pterygoidei that is limited posteriorly by flange on the parietal, rather than extending onto the prootic (see Groombridge 1980| Fig. 3/4)| in being mostly blackish dorsally with narrow pale (cream to yellowish) markings (Fig. 1)| in lacking a regular, parallel-sided mid-dorsal stripe (and a series of dark, approximately semicircular markings immediately lateral to this stripe| Figs. 1, 2, 6)| and in having a black middorsal marking on the head that extends anteriorly to between the nostrils (Figs. 1, 2). Among species of the subgenus Macrocerastes, the new species differs also from B. rhinoceros and B. gabonica in having a mostly dark rather than pale dorsal surface of the head. Unlike B. nasicornis, the new species lacks posteriorly notched scales. Unlike B. parviocula, the new species has facets on the frontals for articulation with the prefrontals that do not meet medially (Fig. 3), and it also lacks a subhorizontal ridge on the lateral surface of the prootic overhanging the foramen for the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (Fig. 4). See Remarks section for additional possible differences between the new species and its most similar congener, B. parviocula.<br>

Bothriechis nubestris differs from all other Bothriechis species except B. nigroviridis by having  <span style="color: green;">green</span>  dorsal coloration with  <span style="color: green;">heavy black</span>  <span style="color: red;">mottling</span>  and a  <span style="color: green;">blackish</span>  <span style="color: red;">iris</span>  Bothriechis nubestris differs from B. nigroviridis (see Table 1 for summary) by the combination of having  <span style="color: green;">150–160</span>  ventral scales (136–149 in B. nigroviridis), thin, often kidney-shaped  <span style="color: red;">supraoculars</span>  with a wide intersupraocular space (B. nigroviridis usually have wider  <span style="color: red;">supraoculars</span>  never kidney-shaped, with narrow intersupraocular space), and higher average counts of  <span style="color: red;">interrictals</span>  dorsals, and subcaudal scales than B. nigroviridis.<br>
<br>
Vipera walser	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: Vipera walser sp. nov. is generally similar to the species of the subgenus Pelias and can be confused with V. berus, which co-occurs on the Alps in allopatry (Fig. 6, Table 2). The species differs in a generalized higher count of cephalic scales, in particular the ones listed below (V. berus in parentheses): higher number of  <span style="color: red;">crown scales</span> : <span style="color: green;">7–30, mean 17.4</span> (versus 4–22, mean 13.0)| <span style="color: red;">loreals</span> : <span style="color: green;">4–15, mean 9.36</span> (versus 2–12, mean 6.72)| and, to a lesser extent, <span style="color: red;">perioculars</span> : <span style="color: green;">16–23, mean 19.8</span> (versus 13–23, mean 18.4) (see Table 2). V. walser, in contrast to V. berus, also shows a marked tendency towards fragmentation of the cephalic large shields: the  <span style="color: red;">parietal scales</span>  are often completely broken down into several smaller scales: <span style="color: green;">2–14, mean 6.3</span> (versus 2–10, mean 2.4| see also Fig. 7). Less commonly, also the  <span style="color: red;">frontal scale</span>  is  <span style="color: green;">fragmented</span>  into smaller scales. Some individuals exhibit a  <span style="color: red;">dorsum</span>  of the head  <span style="color: green;">covered in small, irregular scales</span>  like in V. aspis. V. walser has between 1.5 and 2 rows of subocular scales on both sides of the head in 85% of the analysed specimens (V. berus has typically one row of suboculars, with the exception of some populations in the southern Alps). The dorsal  <span style="color: red;">zigzag</span>  is often  <span style="color: green;">broken down into separate bars</span>  as in Vipera aspis (Linnaeus, 1758) or Vipera berus bosniensis (see Fig. 6). Despite the lack of a strictly diagnostic morphological character, V. walser can be readily distinguished from populations of V. berus from Central and northern Europe by a combination of several characters (e.g. the number of subocular scales, fragmentation of parietals and number of apicals). Identification based solely on observation of external morphology is less obvious if individuals of V. berus from southern Alps are considered. Despite this, discriminant analysis correctly identified individuals to species in 94% of females and 88% of males, based on a set of analysed characters (see Figs 2 and 3). The mean  <span style="color: red;">p-distance</span>  based on a combined dataset of about 3000 base pairs of mitochondrial genes, between V. berus and V. walser is  <span style="color: green;">5.36%</span>  Based on our current knowledge of its  <span style="color: red;">distribution</span>  Vipera walser is  <span style="color: green;">restricted to the alps north of town of biella</span>  a subrange of the Pennine Alps, west of the river Ticino, north-western Italy (Fig. 8).The differences in cephalic scale count between Vipera walser and V. berus are shown in Table 2: <span style="color: red;">crown scales</span> (females: t45,49 = 4.81, p < 0.0001| males: t28,71 = 5.20, p < 0.0001)| <span style="color: red;">loreals</span> (females: t94,59 = -7.52, p < 0.0001| males: t62,67 = -4.43, p < 0.0001)| and, in females only, <span style="color: red;">perioculars</span> (female: t64,16 = 5.33, p < 0.0001| males: t17,25 = -0.16, p = 0.87) and apicals (females: t32,86 = 2.14, p = 0.04| males: t18,08 = -0.12, p = 0.91)| the number of scales between the eyes and the supralabials are higher (females: t66,40 = 5.85, p < 0.0001| males: t37,93 = 7.90, p < 0.0001).<br>

Gloydius rubromaculatus	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: The above mentioned specimens were identified as the members of Gloydius judging on their small body size, bilateral pits and divided subcaudal scales (Hoge and Romano-Hoge, 1981), while differ from other congeneric species in the following characteristics: 1. two rows of cardinal crossbands on the back, regularly spaced along the body| 2. glossy dorsal scales, compared to matte scales in other members of Gloydius| 3. colubrid-liked dome shaped head in lateral view and oval shaped in dorsal view, compared to flat-shaped head in lateral view and triangular in dorsal view in other Gloydius| 4. irregular small black spots dispersed on the head scales| 5. inconspicuous canthus rostralis| 6. dark brown eyes with black pupils (figs 1 and 2).The new species is distinct from species in the Gloydius blomhoffii complex by having three palatine teeth (versus four palatine teeth)| from the species in the Gloydius halysintermedius complex by having 21 rows of midbody dorsal scales (versus 23-rows). Thus, the new species is suggested to belong to the Gloydius strauchi complex.Within the Gloydius strauchi complex, G. rubromaculatus sp. n. is distinct from G. monticola by its 21-rows mid-body scales (versus 19-rows mid-body scales and 6 supralabials)| from G. himalayanus by its indistinct canthus rostralis (versus very distinct canthus rostralis)| from G. qinlingensis and G. liupanensis by its oval head (versus triangular head), regular crossbands (versus irregular crossbands) and the lack of the white line on each side of body (versus obvious white line)| from G. strauchi by its brownish black eyes (versus light brown eyes), and two rows of regular round crossbands (versus four irregular longitudinal strips).<br>

Agkistrodon laticinctus	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: Combining characteristics for the subspecies A. c. laticinctus and A. c. pictigaster, we provide a diagnosis for A. laticinctus. The broad-banded cop- perhead (A. laticinctus) is a medium-sized pit viper with an average  <span style="color: red;">adult size</span>  of  <span style="color: green;">56–76 cm</span>  and a  <span style="color: red;">maximum size</span>  of  <span style="color: green;">95 cm</span> (Gloyd & Conant, 1990| Conant & Collins, 1991), with a ratio of tail to total length of 0.11–0.18 in males and 0.11–0.16 in females. There is a  <span style="color: green;">single</span>  <span style="color: red;">anal plate</span>  <span style="color: green;">keeled</span>  <span style="color: red;">dorsal scales</span>  and typically 23 midbody scale rows (range 21–25| Gloyd & Conant, 1990). Subcaudals range from 38 to 62 in males and from 39 to 57 in females, whereas  <span style="color: red;">ventral scales</span>  number  <span style="color: green;">138–155</span>  with no variation between sexes (Gloyd & Conant, 1990) <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span>  and  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span>  range from  <span style="color: green;">7 to 10 (mode 8)</span>  and  <span style="color: green;">8 to 12 (mode 10)</span>  respectively, and total postoculars + suboculars range from 2 to 6 (mode 4| Gloyd & Conant, 1990). A combination of geography and colour pattern distinguishes the broad- banded copperhead from related species. There are 10– 18 brown to red  <span style="color: red;">cross-bands</span>  in males (10–21 in A. contortrix) and 10–18 in females (11–20 in A. contortrix) on a light to medium- to light-brown back- ground. <span style="color: red;">cross-bands</span>  <span style="color: green;">do not narrow at midbody</span> (Gloyd & Conant, 1990), whereas they generally narrow at the midbody in A. contortrix. Head coloration typically matches that of the  <span style="color: red;">cross-bands</span>  with a lighter cheek stripe (Gloyd & Conant, 1990). The approximate  <span style="color: red;">distribution</span>  of the A. laticinctus includes  <span style="color: green;">western and central texas, central oklahoma, and eastern kansas</span>  whereas the range of A. contortrix extends from Connecticut to Florida along the Atlantic coast, west to include eastern Texas north through eastern Oklaho- ma into eastern Kansas (Fig. 5A). Hybridization between the broad-banded copperhead and the eastern copperhead occurs along an ecological transition zone from south eastern Texas north to eastern Kansas, defined by an increasing elevation, decreasing precipitation, and transition from mixed forest and cypress swamp to prairie grassland. Diagnosis may be difficult for some individuals in this area without additional morphological data (Fig. 5A) [BURBRINK & GUIHER 2015].<br>

Agkistrodon conanti	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis (conanti): The Florida Cottonmouth (A. conanti) is diagnosed from the subspecies A. p. conanti. This species is a medium- to large-bodied semi-aquatic pit viper with an average adult size 76–122 cm and a maximum size of 189.2 cm (Gloyd & Conant, 1990| Conant & Collins, 1991), with a ratio of tail to total length of 0.15–0.19 in males and 0.13–0.18 in females. There is a  <span style="color: green;">single</span>  <span style="color: red;">anal plate</span>  <span style="color: green;">keeled</span>  <span style="color: red;">dorsal scales</span>  and typically 25  <span style="color: red;">midbody scale rows</span> (range  <span style="color: green;">23–27</span> | Gloyd & Conant, 1990). Subcaudals range from 45 to 54 in males and from 41 to 49 in females, whereas ventral scales number 135–145 in males and 132–144 in females (Gloyd & Conant, 1990). Supralabials and infralabials range from 6 to 10 (mode 8) and 9 to 12 (mode 10), respectively, and total postoculars + suboculars range from 2 to 4 (mode 3| Gloyd & Conant, 1990). A combination of ge- ography and colour pattern distinguishes the Florida cottonmouth from related species. There are 11–16  <span style="color: green;">dark</span>  cross-bands on an olive, <span style="color: green;">brown</span>  or black background, which may become subdued in adults, whereas A. piscivorus generally has 10–17 cross-bands that often become indistinguishable from the ground colour in adults (Gloyd & Conant, 1990). The  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  is typically  <span style="color: green;">brown</span>  with vertical stripes along the snout on the rostrals, prenasals, and first supralabials (Gloyd & Conant, 1990) <span style="color: green;">dark</span>  stripes appear on the lower jaw extending from the mental to the first four or five infralabials (Gloyd & Conant, 1990). A  <span style="color: green;">dark</span>  <span style="color: red;">cheek stripe</span>  is present bordered above and below by pale stripes and often present in adults, although it is often in- distinguishable from the ground colour in adult A. piscivorus (Gloyd & Conant, 1990| Conant & Collins, 1991). The distribution of the Florida Cottonmouth extends from southern Florida to approximately Savannah, Georgia, and west to south-eastern Alabama (Fig. 5B), whereas the Northern Cottonmouth ranges in the USA from south-eastern Virginia to central Georgia, east of the Appalachian Mountains, north to southern Illinois and eastern Kansas. Hybridization between the Florida and Northern cottonmouth occurs in the mid-Atlantic coastal plains in southern North Carolina to the southern coastal plains in south- eastern Louisiana and diagnosis may be difficult without additional morphological and molecular data for some individuals in this area (Burbrink & Guiher 2015: 522).<br>

Gloydius angusticeps	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: The above mentioned specimens were identified as the members of the genus Gloydius based on their small body size, bilateral pits and divided subcaudal scales (Hoge and Romano-Hoge, 1981). The new species differs from other congeneric species in the following characteristics: (i) long and narrow head| (ii) 2 – 4 rows of discrete blackish brown spots on the back| (iii) a pair of round spots on the parietal scales (one on each side)| (iv) a pair of arched stripes on the occiput| (v) small vaporous black spots on the ventral scales| (vi) up to 21 rows (occasionally 19 or 20 rows) of mid-body dorsal scales.Gloydius angusticeps sp. nov. is distinct from species in the Gloydius blomhoffii complex by having three palatine teeth (versus four palatine teeth), and from the Gloydius halys-intermedius complex by having up to 21 rows of mid-body dorsal scale rows (versus generally 23 rows).Comparison within the Gloydius strauchi complex. Gloydius angusticeps sp. nov. is distinct from G. strauchi by having 2 – 4 rows of small discrete spots on the back (versus four zigzag longitudinal strips) and slender head shape| differs from G. monticola by having 7 supralabials (versus always 6 supralabials) and >30 pairs of subcaudal scales (versus always less than 30 pairs)| differs from G. rubromaculatus by having dark brown spots or ×-shaped patterns on the dorsum (versus large red crossbands), matt dorsal scales (versus glossy dorsal scales) and slender triangular head (versus oval head)| differs from G. qinlingensis and G. liupanensis by its grayish brown body coloration (versus yellowish brown) and lacking of a lateral white line (versus obvious white line)| differs from G. himalayanus by possessing an indistinct canthus rostralis (versus very distinct canthus rostralis, Gloyd and Conant, 1990).<br>

Macrovipera razii	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: The newly described species differs from M. schweizeri by its higher number of mid-dorsal scales (25 vs. 23), which however overlaps the counts in other M. lebetina subspecies. Macrovipera razii sp. n. differs from M. lebetina by possessing a higher count of ventrals (172–175 vs. 160–170), and by having elongated anterior chin-shields, which are more than three times longer than the posterior ones. In contrast, M. lebetina has square anterior chin-shields, which are less than twice as long as the posterior chin-shields (Fig. 6). Compared to M. lebetina, the new species has a lower number of canthal + intersupraocular scales. More comparisons are provided in Table 4. Interestingly, Macrovipera razii sp. n. and M. lebetina cernovi are similar in both possessing one large supraocular scale, which is absent in M. lebetina obtusa (Fig. 5). Outside Iran, the subspecies M. lebetina euphratica (Schmidt, 1939) differs by having supraoculars that are split up into five scales, making it clearly distinguishable from Macrovipera razii sp. n., which has one large supraocular scale. The latter can be distinguished from Macrovipera lebetina lebetina (Linnaeus, 1758) and Macrovipera lebetina transmediterranea (Nilson & Andrén 1988) by the higher number of ventrals (172– 175 vs. 146–163 and 150–164, respectively), from Macrovipera lebetina turanica (Chernov, 1940) by the latter’s semidivided supraoculars and a dorsal colour pattern that consists of a dark ground colour with a lighter, orange zigzag pattern. (Oraie et al. 2018)Description of holotype (Figs 5–7): A viper with a robust and massive body. <span style="color: red;">snout–vent length</span> (SVL) <span style="color: green;">1110 mm</span>  and  <span style="color: red;">tail length</span> (TaL) <span style="color: green;">160 mm</span>  Length of head from tip of rostral to end of lower jaw  <span style="color: green;">46.92 mm</span>  and width of head at widest point 34.76 mm. The head is broad and triangular with a bluntly rounded snout, well distinct from neck, covered with small, imbricate and strongly keeled scales. Dorsal side of head with 55 small, imbricate and strongly keeled scales (canthal + intersupraocular scales), and 10 small scales between supraoculars (intrasupraoculars). Eye bordered by a complete circumocular ring of 15 scales including one large supraocular. This circle is bordered by 21–22 scales in an outer ring. Loreals 15, of which 5 are in contact with the nasal scale. One nasorostral scale, partly fused with nasal. Two canthal scales (supranasals) above nasal, one apical scale above rostral. Twelve supralabials on each side (4th largerst, its length greater than width), and 13 infralabials more or less equal in size. Anterior chin-shields more than three times longer than the posterior ones, 3–4 infralabials in contact with anteriormost chin-shield. 175 ventral scales, which are followed by 47 divided subcaudal scales. Anal scute entire. 24 rows of dorsal scales, strongly keeled, around anterior dorsum (one  <span style="color: red;">head length</span>  behind head), 25 rows at mid-body, and 17 rows around posterior body (one  <span style="color: red;">head length</span>  before anal scute). Dorsum shiny black throughout, belly dark, anterior part of ventral face with irregular light blotches. (Oraie et al. 2018)Paratype (Fig. 8): Body shape and coloration are very similar to that of the holotype. One large supraocular scale| 2/2 canthal scales| 10 interocular scales in a line between the eyes| 1 apical scale| 15 inner circumocular scales on each side, including suparaocular| 19/19 outer circumoculars on each side| 10/11 (l/r) supralabials| 12/13 (l/r) infralabials| dorsal scale rows 24/25/19| 172 ventrals: anal scute entire| 47 pairs of subcaudals. <span style="color: red;">snout–vent length</span>  <span style="color: green;">1110 mm</span>  tail 180 mm. Length of head 50.84 mm and width of head at widest point 34.73 mm. (Oraie et al. 2018)Chromatic variation: There is considerable geographic variation in the colour pattern of Macrovipera razii sp. n. Despite their very close genetic relationship (Fig. 2) and weak within-group genetic divergence (0.7%), individuals from Fars Province, southern Iran, (ERP 1981, ERP 1518, ERP 1531) differ significantly in their colour pattern from the holotype and paratype (Fig. 9). Rather than having an entirely black colour, their dorsum is brownish grey with narrow crossbars, and the ventral side is a little lighter than the dorsum with small black dots. Geographic variation in colour pattern could be strongly related to landscape features and altitude, as is suggested by the holotype and paratype with their black colour occurring in high-altitude habitats with black rocks.

Vipera sakoi	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: Small-sized snake, males have mini- mal value of midbody scales (19), loreals, apicals and crown shields, a relatively large number of preven- trals, and maximum number of supralabials| females have maximum number of ventrals and supralabials, minimal value of sublabials, loreals and number of shields around an eye, a relatively small number of zigzag wings. Vipers of both sexes from Erzincan differ from all other vipers under comparison by minimum number of loreals and maximal number of supralabials. From above, males are painted in grey, females, in light brown tones (Fig. 4)| zigzag consists of not numerous transversely elongated stains, united only in some places in males, the zigzag is well devel- oped in females. The belly is light-grey in females and dark-spotted grey in males. Both sexes have a white throat (Fig. 5).<br>

Bothrops sonene	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: Bothrops sonene can be distinguished from its congeners by the exclusive combination of the following morphological characters: dorsal color pattern of body consisting of small C-shaped blotches, apparently unique for the genus| postocular stripe originating posteriorly to the eye, two or two and a half scales width, covering three or four posterior supralabials| dorsum of the head with paired markings arranged symmetrically| venter cream heavily speckled with brown| lacunolabial scale absent, prelacunal discrete contacting second supralabial| prefoveals three to five| subfoveal single and usually present| postfoveals absent to two| <span style="color: red;">canthals</span>  two| <span style="color: red;">intersupraoculars</span>  seven| suboculars one or two| postoculars two or three| supralabials seven or eight| infralabials nine to eleven| interrictals 26–27| middorsal scales 23–25| ventrals 172 in the female, 169–173 in males| <span style="color: red;">subcaudals</span>  <span style="color: green;">divided, 45 in the female, 50 in males</span> Comparisons. Bothrops sonene is easily distinguished from its congeners by its unique dorsal color pattern of relatively small and C-shaped blotches. It is distinguished from B. atrox, B. barnetti, B. jararaca, B. jararacussu, B. pictus and B. taeniatus by the absence of a lacunolabial scale (= prelacunal fused with second supralabial), a condition shared with the species of the B. alternatus and B. neuwiedi groups. Similar C-shaped (or in the shape of a headphone) dorsal blotches are present in B. alternatus, B. cotiara, B. fonsecai, B. itapetiningae and B. jonathani (B. alternatus group excluding B. ammodytoides, whose dorsal blotches are quadrangular)| however, the blotches of B. sonene are smaller and rounder than those species, the lower set of blotches are well separated from each other (except in B. itapetiningae), and blotches are bordered with black (vs. bordered with white). The new species can also be distinguished from some species of the B. alternatus group by the postocular stripe starting posteriorly to the eye (vs. below the eye in B. alternatus, B. jonathani and B. ammodytoides), number of prefoveals (3–5 vs. 3– 15), subfoveals (0–1 vs. 1–6), supralabials (8 vs. 8–12) and infralabials (9–11 vs. 10–15), length of hemipenes (relatively short vs. long), and fusiform and divergent hemipenial lobes (vs. parallel and subcylindrical lobes). Bothrops sonene is more similar to the B. neuwiedi group of species than to the rest of the species of the genus. They all have a symmetrical pattern of blotches in the dorsum of the head, a brown and relatively wide postocular stripe that extends posterior to the rictal region, a discrete prelacunal scale contacting the second supralabial, and similar number of prefoveals, subfoveals, supralabials and infralabials. They also bear resemblance in hemipenial morphology| the overall morphology of the hemipenis of the new species is identical to that of the species of the B. neuwiedi group, which is characteristic of that group.

Trimeresurus arunachalensis	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: Trimeresurus arunachalensis sp. nov. differs from all mainland Asian pitvipers of northeastern India and adjacent China except T. medoensis (i.e., from Ovophis monticola, Protobothrops himalayanus, P. jerdonii, P. kaulbacki, P. mucrosquamatus, Trimeresurus albolabris, T. erythrurus, T. gumprechti, T. popeiorum, T. stejnegeri, T. tibetanus, and T. vogeli) in having  <span style="color: green;">17</span>  <span style="color: red;">dorsal scale rows</span>  at midbody.Trimeresurus arunachalensis sp. nov. can be distinguished from T. medoensis by its distinctive  <span style="color: red;">hemipenis</span> — <span style="color: green;">unforked, slender, attenuate</span>  and with no spines visible to the naked  <span style="color: red;">eye</span> (vs forked, spinose  <span style="color: red;">hemipenis</span>  with large spines)| by its  <span style="color: red;">scales</span>  being  <span style="color: green;">acutely keeled</span> (vs obtuse keels which are like ‘loose folds of skin’ — David et al., 2001)| by its overall coloration being  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">reddish-brown</span> </span> (vs. green)| by having a  <span style="color: green;">white</span>  <span style="color: red;">lateral stripe</span>  on the outer posterior edges of ventrals or sometimes the first dorsal scale row (vs. <span style="color: red;">lateral stripe</span> — red below, <span style="color: green;">white</span>  above on first dorsal scale row)| and by a  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">reddish-brown</span> </span>  <span style="color: red;">eye</span> (vs. green).

Bothrops monsignifer	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: Bothrops monsignifer may be distinguished from its congeners by the unique combination of the following morphological features: canthorostrals, a feature absent in the rest of Bothrops, present in some specimens| prelacunal fused or partially fused with 2nd supralabial| internasals 1/1, sometimes separated by one scale| rostral trapezoidal| <span style="color: red;">canthals</span>  1/1, oval to rounded, with similar size or slightly larger than internasals| medial intercanthals 3–4| intersupraoculars 8–12| intercanthals and intersupraoculars keeled and frequently slightly keeled| supraoculars oval| suboculars 1–3| postoculars 2–3| <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">loreal</span> </span> </span>  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">subtriangular</span> </span> | prefoveals 2–6| subfoveals absent| postfoveals 0–2| scales between suboculars and 4th supralabial 1–2| supralabials 7–8| infralabials 9–11| middorsal scales 23–25| ventrals in females 189–195, in males 182–190| subcaudals in females 48–58, in males 54–63| subcaudals divided, exceptionally some of them entire| dorsal blotches triangular or  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">subtriangular</span> </span>  dark brown, usually fused on the vertebral line| additional markings between the blotches absent or faint in females, present and conspicuous in males| conspicuous and dark postocular stripe, 2.5–3.0 scales width, starting posteriorly to the eye, encroaching 2–3 supralabials and one infralabial, not bordered dorsally by a pale band (a feature displayed by many bothropoid species).Comparisons (conditions for other species in parentheses) (Fig. 9). Bothrops monsignifer is easily distinguished from the species of Bothrocophias by the pattern of  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">subtriangular</span> </span>  and conspicuous dorsolateral blotches along the body (vs. crossbands irregularly outlined), the absence of upturned snout (vs. presence) and the absence of tuberculate keels in body scales (vs. presence). However, Bothrops monsignifer is similar to Bothrocophias microphthalmus and B. hyoprora by the presence of canthorostrals, tiny scales located between the rostral, nasal, internasal and/or canthal (Fig. 8D). Although not present in all the specimens of Bothrops monsignifer, these unusual scales distinguish the new species from its congeners, as they were not observed in any other species of Bothrops.Bothrops monsignifer is easily distinguished from the species of the “B. alternatus” and “B. neuwiedi” groups by the condition of the prelacunal scale fused with 2nd supralabial (Figs. 8B–D) (vs. not fused), and the absence of subfoveals (vs. presence). They are also distinguished by the pattern of  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">subtriangular</span> </span>  and conspicuous dorsolateral blotches on the body (vs. C-shaped or rectangular in “Bothrops alternatus” and trapezoidal in “B. neuwiedi”). Some immature males of Bothrops monsignifer may be confused with B. mattogrossensis (geographically close member of “B. neuwiedi”), because of their dark spots between dorsolateral blotches and labial scales (which tend to fade in adult males), features present in B. mattogrossensis.The new species is distinguished from species of the “Bothrops atrox” and “B. jararaca” groups by the oval to rounded  <span style="color: red;">canthals</span> (Figs. 8E–F) (vs. elongated). It can be distinguished from Bothrops atrox (a geographically close member of the “B. atrox” group) by its pattern of  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">subtriangular</span> </span>  and conspicuous dorsolateral blotches (vs. trapezoidal with diffuse and pale edges), the presence of white bands over a dark ground color on the tail (vs. absence) and the ventral speckling (vs. ventral checkerboard pattern). Bothrops monsignifer can be easily distinguished from the species of the “B. taeniatus” group by the pattern of dorsolateral  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">subtriangular</span> </span>  body blotches (vs. banded) and the absence of black-greenish or brown-greenish coloration (vs. presence).Bothrops monsignifer is similar to species of the “B. atrox”, “B. jararaca”, “B. jararacussu”, and “B. taeniatus” groups in the presence of a lacunolabial (i.e. prelacunal fused with 2nd supralabial) and the absence of subfoveals. They also share the general shape of supralabials, which are bigger in size than those of species of the “Bothrops alternatus” and “B. neuwiedi” groups. The new species is most similar to Bothrops sanctaecrucis and B. brazili, geographically close species of the “B. jararacussu” group. They resemble each other in having oval to rounded internasals and  <span style="color: red;">canthals</span>  and dark, conspicuous, triangular or  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">subtriangular</span> </span>  dorsolateral blotches. The absence of additional markings between dorsolateral blotches has only been observed in Bothrops muriciencis (a member of “B. jararacussu”, endemic to northeastern Brazil). Bothrops monsignifer can be distinguished from B. brazili by numbers of ventrals, prefoveals, medial intercanthals and gulars (Table 2), larger dorsolateral blotches, and broad dark brown postocular stripe (vs. thin light brown or gray). It can be distinguished from Bothrops sanctaecrucis by numbers of ventrals, prefoveals, medial intercanthals, gulars and intersupraoculars (Table 2), and by the relative size of  <span style="color: red;">canthals</span> (small vs. large). The new species may be confused with Bothrops sanctaecrucis given their similar pattern of body coloration, but they are easily distinguished by the condition of the postocular stripe, which is conspicuous and  <span style="color: green;">wide</span>  in B. monsignifer and faint or absent in B. sanctaecrucis. We refer to Table 2 for additional comparisons between Bothrops monsignifer and geographically close species of Bothrocophias and Bothrops.<br>

Atheris mongoensis	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: Atheris mongoensis sp. nov. se distingue de toutes les autres espèces du genre Atheris par la combinaison de caractères suivante : (1) la présence sur le dessus de la tête et notamment au-dessus des yeux et dans la région temporale d’écailles allongées, lancéolées et dressées, avec à leur extrémité un petit tubercule (“knob” sensu Broadley 1998), contrastant avec la présence habituelle au centre de la région interorbitale de quelques écailles aplaties, élargies et à peine carénées| (2) le changement d’aspect des écailles sous-caudales le long de la queue, où elles sont successivement d’abord entières, puis divisées et finalement très étroites et lancéolées| (3) la présence de 19 à 21 rangs d’écailles dorsales à mi-corps, de 141 à 152 ventrales et de 43 à 55 sous-caudales| (4) l’existence habituelle de trois suprarostrales, de deux écailles entre la nasale et l’œil, et de deux rangées d’écailles entre l’œil et les supralabiales chez les femelles tandis que la deuxième rangée est absente chez les mâles.Comparaison avec d’autres espèces: En Afrique occidentale et centrale, sur les neuf espèces d’Atheris connues, deux présentent des écailles dressées dans la région céphalique : A. hirsuta et A. hispida. Toutes les deux diffèrent d’A. mongoensis sp. nov. par plusieurs caractères, dont notamment pour A. hirsuta par des yeux beaucoup plus grands (leur diamètre est environ trois fois supérieur à la distance à la lèvre au lieu de 0,9 à 1,4 fois chez A. mongoenis sp. nov.), un plus grand nombre de ventrales (environ 160 au lieu de 141-152), moins de rangs de dorsales à mi-corps (15 ou 16 au lieu de 19 à 21) et l’absence de sous-caudales divisées (Ernst & Rödel 2002, Penner et al. 2013). De même, A. hispida diffère d’A. mongoensis sp. nov. par une série de caractères dont notamment des yeux nettement plus grands (leur diamètre est environ deux fois supérieur à la distance à la lèvre), moins de rangs dorsaux à mi-corps (16 à 19) et l’absence de sous-caudales divisées (Broadley 1998). Les autres espèces d’Afrique occidentale et centrale diffèrent d’A. mongoensis sp. nov. par l’écaillure céphalique et sous-caudale, ainsi que par divers autres caractères dont notamment le nombre de rangs dorsaux pour A. chlorechis (de 27 à 37), A. nitschei (de 23 à 34) et A. katangensis (de 23 à 31), le contact de l’œil avec les supralabiales et le petit nombre de rangs dorsaux (de 14 à 16) pour A. subocularis, et la coloration céphalique ainsi que la présence d’un seul rang de sous- oculaires dans les deux sexes pour A. broadleyi (Lawson 1999, Lawson et al. 2001, Broadley 2008). Concernant A. squamigera et A. anisolepis, les deux espèces d’Afrique centrale dont la répartition géographique comprend l’ouest de la RDC et dont Lawson et Ustach (2000) avaient proposé la synonymie, la comparaison de nos spécimens de RDC montre d’une part que ceux attribuables à A. squamigera et à A. anisolepis appartiennent bien à deux espèces distinctes, ainsi que l’indiquait Broadley (2008), et qu’ils diffèrent d’A. mongoensis sp. nov., outre par l’absence de sous-caudales divisées (Figs 16-18) et d’écailles céphaliques lancéolées et dressées, par les caractères suivants (Tableau I) : pour A. squamigera par la présence d’un seul rang de sous-oculaires dans les deux sexes (habituellement deux rangs complets chez les femelles d’A. anisolepis et d’A. mongoensis sp. nov., le deuxième rang habituellement incomplet chez les mâles d’A. anisolepis et absent chez ceux d’A. mongoensis sp. nov.)| pour A. anisolepis par un nombre supérieur de rangs de dorsales chez les femelles (23 - 25), un plus grand nombre de ventrales dans les deux sexes (153 – 170), et la présence habituelle de cinq suprarostrales (seulement trois chez A. squamigera et A. mongoensis sp. nov.) et de trois écailles entre la nasale et l’œil (seulement deux chez A. squamigera et A. mongoensis sp. nov.).<br>

Protobothrops kelomohy	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: Protobothrops kelomohy sp. nov. differs from other species of the genus by the combination of the following characters: 1) relative larger body size ( <span style="color: red;">tl</span>  up to  <span style="color: green;">1310 mm</span> )| 2) <span style="color: red;">dorsal scale rows</span>  <span style="color: green;">23– 23–17</span>  all keeled| 3) <span style="color: red;">ventral scales</span>  <span style="color: green;">231-234</span> | 4) high number of  <span style="color: red;">subcaudals</span> ( <span style="color: green;">80-84 pairs</span> )| 5) <span style="color: green;">8-9</span>  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span> | 6) <span style="color: green;">12-13</span>  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span> | 7) typical lance-head pattern on upper head surface| 8) three bold vertical facial stripes, (first from internasal, second from facial pit, third from eye) and a bold postocular stripe extending obliquely downwards on temporal region then curved down immediately at the end of the last supralabial| 9) <span style="color: red;">dorsal body and tail</span>  <span style="color: green;">reddish-brown</span>  each scale with black edges| transverse blotches, somewhat fused together as a zigzag median line on dorsum and a row of large ventrolateral blotches on each side, each darker marking edged with a narrow yellow line.Comparisons. A comparison of Protobothrops kelomohy sp. nov. with the other species of genus Protobothrops is shown in Table 5. The absence of a hornlike supraocular in Protobothrops kelomohy sp. nov. easily distinguishes it from P. cornutus and P. sieversorum| by its high number of ventrals, greater than 200, Protobothrops kelomohy sp. nov. ( <span style="color: green;">231-234</span> ) differs from P . dabieshanensis (187), P . elegans (179-196), P. jerdonii jerdonii (160-173), P. jerdonii bourreti (189-192), P. jerdonii xanthomelas (176-188), P. mangshanensis (187-198), P . maolanensis (186-193), P . trungkhanhensis (188-194) and P . xiangchengensis (175-194)| by its lesser number of mid-body scale rows, Protobothrops kelomohy sp. nov. (23) differs from P . flavoviridis (33-39), P. himalayanus (25), P . kaulbacki (25) and P . tokarensis (31-33). Protobothrops kelomohy sp. nov. differs from P. mucrosquamatus by the number of mid-body  <span style="color: red;">dorsal scale rows</span>  23, all keeled distinctly vs 25 – 27 (rarely 23) and keeled, except the 1st row smooth in P. mucrosquamatus, one loreal (vs two) and the presence of vertical stripes from eyes (vs absent). Furthermore, Protobothrops kelomohy sp. nov. is slightly longer, has higher numbers of ventrals, <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span>  and  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span>  than P. mucrosquamatus ( <span style="color: red;">tl</span>  max 1,310 mm vs 1,280 mm, V 231 – 234 vs194–233,SL8–9vs7–8,IL12–13 vs 11 – 12) (Table 5 in Sumontha et al. 2020).<br>

Atheris hetfieldi	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: The newly described species can be distinguished from all other members of the genus by a combi- nation of characters: 1) “horns” above the eyes absent| 2) one or two rows of scales between the eyes and supralabi- als| 3) lack of lanceolate or acuminate scales on top of the head| 4) lack of conspicuous lateral and/or dorsal mark- ings on the head| 5) 23 to 25 dorsal scale rows at midbody| 6) 153 ventral scales| 7) 47 to 50 undivided subcaudals| 8) four suprarostrals| 9) 10 interorbitals and 19–20 interrictals| 10) a background dorsal coloration brownish-green, with a series of large transverse dark markings.Specifically, regarding the more geographically proximate species of the genus, the newly described species can be easily distinguished from the sympatric A. squamigera by having four suprarostrals (usually three in A. squami- gera, see Fig. 4), three scales between the eye and the nasal (two in A. squamigera), and an higher number of inter- rictals (19–20 in Atheris hetfieldi sp. nov. versus 14 to 16 in A. squamigera)| it can be distinguished from the phe- netically similar West African Atheris chlorechis by having 23 to 25 midbody scale rows (25–37 in A. chlorechis), a brownish-green coloration pattern with dark brown marking on the dorsum (uniformly leaf green in A. chlorechis), and four suprarostrals of different sizes (the outer two much larger that the inner two in A. hetfieldi sp. nov. versus four irregular but small and about the same size in A. chlorechis), and a smaller number of interrictals (19–20 in A. hetfieldi sp. nov. versus 25–27 in A. chlorechis). It can be immediately distinguished from A. subocularis by having one or two rows of scales between eye and supralabials (eye in direct contact with supralabials in A. subocularis). It differs from A. mongoensis in having 23 to 25 midbody scales rows (19–21 in A. mongoensis), a higher number of ventral scales (153 in A. hetfieldi sp. nov. versus 141–152 in A. mongoensis), and in having undivided subcaudals (divided in the posterior part of the tail in A. mongoensis). It can be distinguished from A. broadleyi by lacking a conspicuous dark band between the posterior part of the eye and the corner of the mouth (usually present in A. broadleyi), by having one or two rows of scales between eye and supralabials (suboculars always in direct contact with supralabials in A. broadleyi), by having four suprarostrals (only three in A. broadleyi)| a higher number of in- teroculars (10–12 in A. hetfieldi sp. nov. versus 3–8 in A. broadleyi), and a higher number of interrictals (19–20 in A. hetfieldi sp. nov. versus 14–18 in A. broadleyi). The new species differs from A. anisolepis by having a higher number of interorbitals (10–12 in A. hetfieldi sp. nov, versus 6–8 in A. anisolepis), a higher number of interrictals (19–20 in A. hetfieldi sp. nov. versus 14 –18 in A. anisolepis), and by having four suprarostrals (usually three in A. anisolepis). Finally, it can be easily distinguished from A. hirsuta by lacking lanceolate or acuminate scales on top of the head (a distinctive “hairy” appearance in A. hirsuta) by having three scales between the eye and the nasal (two in A. hirsuta), and by having 23–25 midbody scale rows (16 in A. hirsuta).Besides the obvious geographic distribution gap, the newly described species can be distinguished from their central and eastern African congeners by the following characters: it can be immediately distinguished from A. ceratophora and A. matildae by the lack of supraocular scales similar to “horns”| it can be distinguished from A. hispida and H. acuminata by lacking lanceolate or acuminate scales on top of the head (a distinctive “hairy” appear- ance in A. hispida and A. acuminata)| it can be distinguished from A. desaixi by not having lateral scales serrated, having 20 interrictals (22 in A. desaixi), a lower number of ventrals (153 in A. hetfieldi sp. nov. versus 164 –168 in A. desaixi), and by having a dark-green background dorsal coloration (black in A. desaixi)| from A. nitschei by lacking black arrowhead markings on the top of the head and black lateral stripe from the tip of snout, through the eye to the temporal region (typical of A. nitschei)| from A. rungweensis by having a lower number of interrictals (20 in A. hetfieldi sp. nov. versus 24–26 in A. rungweensis), by having four suprarostrals (usually three in A. run- gweensis) and by lacking the typical yellow dorsolateral zig-zag lines and yellowish markings on the labials| from A. katangensis by having a higher number of ventrals (153 versus 133–144 in A. katangensis) and lacking serrations on the lateral scales (serrated in A. katangensis)| from A. barbouri by having a prehensile tail (non-prehensile tail in A. barbouri| see Spawls & Branch 2020), a higher number of ventrals (153 in A. hetfieldi sp. nov. versus 115–127 in A. barbouri), a higher number of subcaudals (47–50 in A. hetfieldi sp. nov. versus 15–23 in A. barbouri), a con- siderably greater maximum known total length (52 cm in A. hetfieldi sp. nov. versus 36.9 cm in A. barbouri)| and from A. mabuensis by its greater maximum known total length (52 cm in A. hetfieldi sp. nov. versus 38.4 cm in A. mabuensis), by having one or two rows of scales between eye and supralabials (suboculars in direct contact with supralabials in A. mabuensis), and a higher number of ventrals (153 in A. hetfieldi sp. nov. versus 128–137 in A. mabuensis).Variation. Variation in measurements and scalation of the paratypes of A. hetfieldi sp. nov. is presented in Table 1. The paratype agrees in general with the holotype, although it has only one row of scales between the eye and the supralabials (two in the holotype) and a higher number of neck, midbody and caudal scale rows, and interoculars (see Table 1 in Ceriaco et al. 2020).<br>

Trimeresurus davidi	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: Trimeresurus davidi sp. nov. is an arboreal member of the genus Trimeresurus restricted to the Car Nicobar Island of the Nicobar archipelago, characterized by: medium to large sized body (277–835 mm SVL)| dorsal scales in a series of 21–25:21–23:15–17 rows| nasal partly fused with the first supralabial| 166–179 ventrals| 46–70 subcaudals| one preocular| 2–3 postoculars| 10–12 supralabials| 12–15 infralabials| two internasals usually in contact with each other| 11–14 cephalic scales| relative tail length (TaL/TL) ranging from 0.143–0.20| dorsal and ventral verdant green in color, lacking white ventrolateral stripes| males with a white supralabial streak, bordered by a reddish tinge above| a pair of white and red stripes along the sides of the tail in both males and females| a reddish brown colored tail and a greenish iris| hemipenis reaching the 13th caudal plate.Variation: Measurements and scale counts of the paratypes and referred material are given in Table 1. Mid-body scale rows range from 21–25:21–23:15–17| ventrals range from 170–179 in males and 166–178 in females. Subcaudals range from 67–70 in males and 55– 64 in females. Internasals usually in contact with each other, but separated by a small scale in one specimen. Cephalic scales range from 11–14| postoculars range from 2–3. Relative tail length in males: 0.178–0.200| in females: 0.143–0.161. Sexual dimorphism apparent in body for the tail dimensions and the number of subcaudals. Verdant green colored in life, both dorsally and ventrally, without a white ventrolateral pair of stripes along the sides of the body| but with a pair of white and red lateral stripes along the sides of the tail. Males have a thin white labial stripe bordered by red above the supralabials on either side of the head (absent in females) and a white stripe bordered by red along the subcaudals from the vent until about half the length of the tail (also present in females).Comparison. Trimeresurus davidi sp. nov. does not have any superficially similar looking, green-colored arboreal congeners on Car Nicobar Island, on which its distribution is restricted. It can be distinguished from other members of the T. albolabris complex by the following combination of characters: dorsal scales of T. davidi sp. nov. in 21–25:21–23:15–17 rows (vs. 21– 23:19–21:15inT.albolabrisandT.insularis,21:21:15 in T. caudornatus, 21:19:17 in T. septentrionalis, and 21:19:15 in T. salazar). There is some overlap in this character, as is expected| however, five of the 11 (45%) examined T. davidi specimens had 23 dorsal scale rows at midbody. This character has never been recorded in any of the other species within this complex. Also, there seems to be a certain degree of overlap in scalation characters between the currently recognized members of T. albolabris complex, which makes the partially overlapping values with T. davidi sp. nov. quite understandable. Trimeresurus davidi sp. nov. has 166– 179 ventrals (vs. 149–173 in T. albolabris, 161–163 in T. caudornatus, 160–181 in T. septentrionalis, 156–167 in T. insularis, and 163–171 in T. salazar)| an absence of white ventrolateral stripes along the body in T. davidi sp. nov. (vs. present in T. septentrionalis and T. salazar)| and the presence of a pair of red and white ventrolateral stripes along the sides of the tail (vs. absent in all other species). Trimeresurus davidi sp. nov. is considerably larger than all other species of this complex. For further comparisons, see also the morphological characters (Table 2) for the material examined (Appendix 1) in this study.From the two other sympatric congeners, T. andersoni Theobald, 1868 and T. labialis Fitzinger in: Steindachner, 1867, T. davidi sp. nov. can be distinguished by its verdant green dorsal coloration (vs. predominantly brown in both T. andersoni and T. labialis)| midbody dorsal scales in 21–23 rows (vs. 23–25 in T. andersoni, 23 in T. labialis)| and the first supralabial united with the nasal in T. davidi sp. nov. (vs. separate in T. labialis).Additionally, from the green color morph of Trimeresurus cantori (Blyth 1846) which occurs on islands of the central group of the Nicobar archipelago, T. davidi sp. nov. can be distinguished by a lower number of mid-body scale rows (21–23 in T. davidi sp. nov. vs. 25–29 in T. cantori)| and the absence of a pair of white ventro-lateral stripes along the sides of the body in T. davidi sp. nov. (vs. present in T. cantori) [Whitaker and Captain 2008].Description and Variation: see also Vogel et al. 2022: 354.<br>

Bothrops oligobalius	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: (1) A robust body species, SVL = 245–805 mm, (2) short tail, TL = 35–113 mm| (3) 23–27 dorsals on the first third of the body| (4) 23–25 dorsals at midbody| (5) 18–21 dorsals on the last third of the body| (6) 156–164 ventrals in females (median = 160) and 154–159 in males (median = 156)| (7) <span style="color: red;">anal scale</span>  <span style="color: green;">not divided</span> | (8) 42–48 paired subcaudals in females (median = 44.5) and 47–52 in males (median = 48.8)| (9) 9–13 lateral trapezoidal marks in each side (median = 11,01 and 11,7 on the right and left side, respectively)| (10) post- orbital stripe  <span style="color: green;">absent</span>  or poorly marked| (11) <span style="color: green;">eight</span>  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span> | (12) 10–12 infralabials| (13) second supralabial fused to the prelacunal| (14) <span style="color: red;">belly</span>  <span style="color: green;">checkered</span> | (15) absence of  <span style="color: red;">vertebral stripe</span> Comparisons: Comparisons for meristic and qualitative characters are presented in Table 1. Attributes from other species are presented in parenthesis. The new species can be promptly assigned to the jararacussu group due its morphological similarities with B. brazili, with whom theLike other members in the jararacussu group, the new species presents the second labial scale fused to the prelacunal (separate in the alternatus and neuwiedi groups), postorbital stripe  <span style="color: green;">absent</span>  or faint (present in the alternatus, neuwiedi, atrox and jararaca groups), dorsal skin of the head with homogeneous colouration (blotched or patterned in the alternatus and neuwiedi groups and generally in the atrox group as well), stout and cylindrical bodies and terrestrial habit (slender, laterally com- pressed and arboreal habit in the taeniatus group), reddish and greyish background skin colouration and reddish eye (greenish background colour in the taeniatus group, skin generally brownish in the atrox, jararaca, alternatus and neuwiedi groups) <span style="color: green;">eight</span>  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span>  and lower number of ventrals (generally 7  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span>  and higher number of ventrals in atrox group). Assignment of B. oligobalius to the jararacussu group is further supported by our molecular approach (Figure 1).Within the jararacussu species group, Bothrops oligobalius can be distinguished from B. jararacussu and B. pirajai by the absence or a faint postorbital stripe (present in both species), greyish and reddish background skin colouration (yellowish or brownish back- ground with black trapezoidal marks in both species), reddish eye (yellowish or brownish in both species). The number of ventrals in B. oligobalius (156–164 in females, 154–159 in males) distinguishes it from B. muriciensis (151–155 in females, 148–150 in males) and B. jararacussu (170–186 in females, 166–181 in males) (Table 1). The phylogenetic position of B. oligobalius sister to a clade assembling B. jararacussu, B. pirajai and B. muriciensis (which correspond to the Atlantic Forest lineage in the jararacussu group) is further supported by high genetic divergence and highly disjunct distributions (Figure 1).Bothrops oligobalius is similar to B. brazili in background skin colouration and general external morphology features. However, the species can be promptly distin- guished from B. brazili due to a smaller number of lateral trapezoidal marks (9–13| mean = 11.01 and 11.7 on the right and left side, respectively| in B. brazili, 13–21 mean = 17.1 and 16.3 on the right and left side, respectively) and absence of a  <span style="color: red;">vertebral stripe</span> (present in B. brazili) (Table 1, Figures 2, Figures 3, Figures 5 and Figures 8). Moreover, the low number of ventrals (156–164 in females and 154–159 in males), and subcaudals 42–48 in females and 47–52 in males in B. oligobalius also distinguish it from B. brazili (ventrals 174–186 in females and 175–184 in males, and subcaudals 45–56 in females and 54–61 in males) (Table 1). Molecular analysis recovered these two species as non-sister lineage, with pronounced genetic dis- tances between them. Moreover, the new species occurs north of the Amazon River, while B. brazili is restricted to areas south of the river, with no reported sympatry (Figures 6, Figures 8).Lastly, the new species is distinguished from B. sanctaecrucis, a poorly known member of the jararacussu group from Bolivia, by the lower number of ventrals and caudals (171–185 and 56–57 respectively in B. sanctaecrucis), lower number of lateral trapezoidal marks (18–21), and greyish to reddish background skin colouration (brownish to yellowish).<br>

Trimeresurus kuiburi	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: Trimeresurus kuiburi sp. nov. can be distinguished from all other congeneric species by the combination of its red/purple bands on a green dorsum| white concave suborbital stripe in males| white, spaced vertebral dots in males| pale green belly lacking dark dots or stripe on the lateral sides of the ventrals| partially fused 1st supralabial and nasal scale| 19 dorsal scale rows at midbody| 164–171 ventrals| 63–65 subcaudals in males, 51–53 in females| maximal known SVL of 451 mm| and long, papillose hemipenes. (Sumontha et al. 2021).Comparisons: Among these species, Trimeresurus kuiburi sp. nov. is readily distinguished from the widespread Trimeresurus albolabris, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands endemic T. andersonii, the Nicobar Archipelago endemics T. cantori, T. davidi, T. labialis and T. mutabilis, the Cardamom Mounts endemic T. cardamomensis, the Chinese T. caudornatus, the Indo-Burmese T. erythrurus, the Indonesian Tanahdjampea Island endemic T. fasciatus, the widespread T. guoi, the Vietnamese Hon Son Island endemic T. honsonensis, the Indonesian T. insularis, the Southeast Asian T. macrops, the southern Vietnamese-Cambodian T. rubeus, the Indian T. salazar and the Himalayan T. septentrionalis by its dorsal pattern made of purple-red bands on a green background (David & Vogel 2000| David et al. 2003| Grismer et al. 2008| Malhotra et al. 2011| Vogel et al. 2014| Chandramouli et al. 2020| Chen et al. 2020 a–b| Mirza et al. 2020). Its 19 MSR further separate it from Trimeresurus andersonii (21 MSR), T. cantori (27, 29 or 31), T. cardamomensis (21), T. caudornatus (21), T. davidi (21 or 23), T. erythrurus (23 or 25), T. fasciatus (21), T. guoi (21), T. honsonensis (21), T. insularis (21), T. labialis (21 or 23), T. macrops (21), T. mutabilis (21), T. purpureomaculatus (23–29), T. rubeus (21), T. septentrionalis (21) and most specimens of T. venustus (21, rarely 19). (Sumontha et al. 2021).Color in life: Dorsal surface of head dark green with many scales also partly or entirely dark red, especially on the snout, and the interorbital, temporal and occipital regions. A contrasting white stripe begins under the loreal pit, forms a concave curve under the eye, then continues straight from the 7th to the last supralabial where it stops. Black vertical pupil| iris copper. The background color of the dorsum is dark green, similar to that of the head, with about 62 irregular, dark red crossbands. These red bands are about two dorsal scales long mediodorsally, but narrower on the lower flanks where they are about one dorsal scale long. At the level of the vertebral row, the red bands are generally separated by one dorsal scale. The vertebral row exhibits an interrupted line of white dots, spaced by five or six dorsal scales. Each scale of the lowest dorsal scale row shows a horizontally elongate white spot, forming a continuous white line from the neck to the end of the tail. Most of the scales of the first row also exhibit a smaller red dot, forming a dotted red line. Above the white stripe of the first dorsal scale row, the tail is red, except some thin lighter bands. The infralabials are green and white| the underside of the head is mostly white. The belly is uniformly pale green, of a lighter tone than the background color of the dorsum.

Gloydius lipipengi	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: The specimens of the new species, IVPP OV 2720, IVPP OV 2725 and IVPP OV 2726 were identified as the member of the genus Gloydius based on the small body size, bilateral pits, and divided subcaudal scales (Hoge and Romano- Hoge 1981).  Gloydius lipipengi sp. nov. differs from other congeneric species in the following characteristics: i) third supralabial scale not touching the orbit| ii) a pair of prominent black markings on the occiput| iii) black-bordered greyish cheek stripe extending from the posterior margin of orbit (not separated by the postoculars) to the ventral surface of the neck| iv) black irregular annular crossbands on the mid-body| iv) two rows of black blotches on the ventral side| v) 23-21-15 circum-body scales| vi) 165 ventral scales| and vii) 46 subcaudal scales.  (Shi et al. 2021). Comparisons: Gloydius lipipengi sp. nov. and G. swild sp. nov. can be differentiated from the species in the G. blomhoffii complex by having three palatine teeth (versus four palatine teeth), from the G. halys complex by having 21 rows of mid-body dorsal scales (versus 22 or 23 rows). Gloydius lipipengi sp. nov. differs from other species in G. strauchi complex by the third supralabial scale not touching the orbit, from G. strauchi, G. huangi, and G. rubromaculatus by having large irregular black markings on the back (versus four irregular longitudinal stripes or discrete blotches in G. strauchi, complete dark brown patches in G. huangi, and large red crossbands in G. rubromaculatus (Wang et al. 2019), from G. monticola by having seven supralabials (versus always six supralabials) and more subcaudal scales (46 pairs versus always fewer than 30 pairs), from G. qinlingensis and G. liupanensis by its greyish brown body color (versus yellowish-brown body color) and lacking a lateral white line on each lateral side (versus possessing a lateral white line on each side). Gloydius lipipengi sp. nov. can be differentiated from G. himalayanus by possessing an indistinct canthus rostralis (versus very distinct canthus rostralis| Gloyd and Conant 1990).  (Shi et al. 2021).Color in life: Eye dark brown on the upper half while black on the bottom half, pupil black, vertical with light yellow margins| postorbital stripe wide, greyish brown and black bordered on the lower edge, extending from the posterior orbit to the ventral surface of the neck| supralabials and infralabials greyish brown, scattered with very small irregularly sized black blotches. One black triangular mark on the anterodorsal head, covering the caudomedial part of prefrontals. One bold black M-shaped mark on the dorsomedial head, covering the caudal part of lateral frontals, the lateral part of parietals, merged with the postorbital stripe at the largest temporal scale (but not covering the upper postorbital). The upper postorbital white while the top part of the bottom postorbital is black (covered by the postorbital stripe). (Shi et al. 2021).<br>

Metlapilcoatlus borealis	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: Metlapilcoatlus borealis is a medium-sized, moderately robust viper ( <span style="color: red;">tl</span> : males  <span style="color: green;">657 mm</span>  <span style="color: red;">females</span>  <span style="color: green;">594 mm</span> ), has  <span style="color: green;">22–25</span>  <span style="color: red;">rows of scales</span>  over the mid part of the body, <span style="color: red;">nasorostral scales</span>  <span style="color: green;">4–6</span>  <span style="color: red;">ventrals</span>  <span style="color: green;">130–132</span>  <span style="color: red;">subcaudals</span>  <span style="color: green;">26–35</span>  <span style="color: red;">supraoculars</span>  <span style="color: green;">8–10</span>  <span style="color: red;">interoculabial</span>  <span style="color: green;">2–3</span>  scales from 21–26 shields at the sides of the body before the cloaca. Additionally, Metlapilcoatlus borealis possess three unique nucleotides for  <span style="color: red;">cyt b</span>  at positions  <span style="color: green;">21 (c) 369 (a), 378 (a)</span> | and three for ND4 at positions 192 (C), 405 (G), and 459 (T) (Tepos-Ramírez et al. 2021).Comparisons: Externally, M. borealis can be distinguished from M. indomitus by having fewer ventral scales ( <span style="color: green;">130–132</span>  vs. 133–142)| in addition to the fact that the  <span style="color: red;">rows of scales</span>  in the mid part of the body do not exceed 25 (M. indomitus = 23–25, M. mexicanus = 22–27, M. nummifer = 23–28, M. occiduus = 23–27, M. olmec = 22–26)| with regard to M. mexicanus and M. olmec, M. borealis can be distinguished because the supraocular scales are never divided, whereas in the other two species they can be| the postorbital stripe is narrower with respect to those of M. mexicanus and M. nummifer, covers a lower number of temporal scales (M. borealis = 3–5, M. indomitus = 4, M. mexicanus = 1–7, M. nummifer = 4–8, M. occiduus = 5–6, M. olmec = 3–6)| has a lower average number of  <span style="color: red;">interoculabial</span>  scales (M. borealis = <span style="color: green;">2–3</span>  M. indomitus = 4–5, M. mexicanus = 2–5, M. nummifer = 2–5, M. occiduus = 4–5, M. olmec = <span style="color: green;">4–6</span> ), and a higher number of scales in contact with the  <span style="color: red;">supraoculars</span> (M. borealis = <span style="color: green;">4–6</span>  M. indomitus = 4–5, M. mexicanus = 3–5, M. nummifer = 3–5, M. occiduus = 4, M. olmec = 3–5). Metlapilcoatlus borealis has a completely dark pigmentation in the last third of the body after the cloacal scale, as opposed to other species, where this region is black with light spots. (Tepos-Ramírez et al. 2021).In addition to the differences in external morphology, the more distinctive traits are found in the hemipenial morphology, where M. borealis presents a strongly thickened sulcus spermaticus that turns ventro-diestrally to the apex of the lobes, while it is a thin structure that runs longitudinally along the center of the hemipenes sulcate side in the rest of the species of Metlapilcoatlus| the calyculate area in the interior region of the sulcate side of the hemipenis is laid out obliquely with respect to the spinous area, unlike in the rest of the species where the division of the spinous area and the calyculate area cuts transversally across the sulcate side of the hemipenis, forming a groove shaped like a ‘‘V’’. The exception to this is M. occiduus, where there is no division of the calyculate area, since this species does not appear to have spines in the hemipenes| M. borealis has the smallest hemipenis of the entire genus, even among similarly sized males (M. borealis HL = 13.21, HW = 2.21| M. indomitus HL = 27 mm, HW = 10.5 mm| M. mexicanus HL ‡ 20 mm, HW = 11. 25 mm| M. nummifer = HL ‡ 16 mm, HW = 9 mm| M. occiduus HL ‡ 20 mm, HW = 7.5 mm| M. olmec HL = 20 mm, HW = 10 mm). Metlapilcoatlus borealis can be distinguished from M. mexicanus–M. nummifer–M. olmec by its higher number of spines at the base of the lobes (M. borealis = 6, M. indomitus = 13, M. mexicanus = 4, M. nummifer = 3, M. occiduus = 0, M. olmec = 3) and a higher number of rows of calyces in the lobes (M. borealis = 6, M. indomitus = 13, M. mexicanus = 4, M. nummifer = 3, M. occiduus = 0, M. olmec = 3) (Tepos-Ramírez et al. 2021).Color in life: Collected specimens of M. borealis presented a base coloration ranging from orange to dark brown. Dorsal and lateral blocks always darker than the base color, and sometimes the fringes of the blocks had darker colorations. Ventral coloration went from light yellow and white hues to yellow and orange in the gular region (Tepos-Ramírez et al. 2021).<br>

Gloydius swild	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: Gloydius swild sp. nov. differs from other congeneric species in the following characteristics: i) the narrower postorbital stripe, ii) a pair of round spots on the parietal scales| iii) the absence of the black spots on the lateral body| iv) 21 rows of mid-body dorsal scales| v) a pair of arched stripes on the occiput| vi) 168–170 ventral scales, and vii) 43–46 subcaudal scales. (Shi et al. 2021).Comparisons: Morphologically, Gloydius swild sp. nov. is quite similar to G. angusticeps, but differs by the narrower, straight bordered brown postorbital stripe (versus wider postorbital stripe with dentate lower border in G. angusticeps). G. swild sp. nov. differs from G. strauchi, G. huangi, and G. rubromaculatus by the narrow triangular head from dorsal view (versus spoon-shaped head in above-mentioned species), from G. monticola by having seven supralabials (versus always six supralabials) and more subcaudal scales (43–46 pairs versus always fewer than 30 pairs of subcaudal scales), from G. qinlingensis and G. liupanensis by its dark greyish brown background dorsal color (versus yellowish-brown body color) and lacking a lateral white line on each side (versus possessing a lateral white line on each side), from G. himalayanus by possessing an indistinct canthus rostralis (versus very distinct canthus rostralis| Gloyd and Conant 1990). (Shi et al. 2021).Color in life: Gloydius swild sp. nov., eye light greyish brown on the upper half while black on the bottom half, pupil black, vertical with light yellow margins| postorbital stripe relatively narrow, only half the width of the anterior temporals, greyish brown and white bordered on the lower edge, extending from the posterior orbit to the lateral surface of the neck| supralabials and infralabials greyish white, scattered with large irregularly sized, black blotches, rendering the lateral head granitoid. One black Ω-shaped mark on the anterodorsal head, covering the posteromedial part of prefrontals, the anterior and lateral part of the frontals and the anterior part of the parietals. The infralabials are bordered with yellow on the lower edge.The body coloration is dark blueish-grey, with two rows of irregular black X-shaped or C-shaped crossbands on the mid-body, each covering about 10 dorsal scales (or more), separated by a gap of one or two dorsal scales vertically, sometimes in contact with the adjacent ones forming zigzag stripes, but hardly merged on the medial dorsal line, extending laterally to one or two dorsal scales from the ventrals. Ventral scales light grey, scattered with dense irregular black blotches, rendering the ventral scales granitoid. The tip of tail is bony, similar to the main body in coloration on both ventral and dorsal sides (Figs 1C, D, 3D–F). Despite the inconspicuous variation in the coloration among the type series of G. swild sp. nov., the scalations vary considerably between the two specimens. The range of the temporal scales of the holotype (IVPP OV 2725) is 3+5 on the left side but 2+4 on the right side, while in the paratype (IVPP OV 2726), the temporal scales are displayed as 2+4 on both sides. Ventrals range from 168–170 in females (n = 2), while range from 43–46 in females (n = 3, including one shed skin from the wild). Total length ranges from 529.5–629.1 in adult females. The infralabials of the paratype lack the greyish-yellow margins seen in the holotype. (Shi et al. 2021).<br>

From the mainland population of B. jararaca, males and females of the new species can be mainly distinguished by the smaller SVL, relatively larger head, lower number of ventrals, and a relatively longer tail in males (Tables S11, S12). When compared with other island species, the new species is easily distinguished from B. alcatraz, B. insularis and B. otavioi by several morphologic traits (Tables Sll, S12), but mainly by a smaller head, a greater number of ventrals, and by a greater number of subcaudals in males (see detailed comparison below).

Bothrops jabrensis	Serpentes	Viperidae	DIAGNOSIS: Bothrops jabrensis sp. nov. is distinguished from other species of the B. jararaca group by the following combination of characters: (1) smaller adult size| ( <span style="color: green;">2</span> ) dorsum predominantly grayish and (or) brownish| (3) <span style="color: red;">venter</span>  <span style="color: green;">whitish or light grayish</span> | (4) <span style="color: red;">postorbital stripes</span>  <span style="color: green;">brownish and narrow</span>  with a thin white border| (5) <span style="color: green;">8</span>  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span> | (6) <span style="color: green;">11</span>  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span> | ( <span style="color: green;">7</span> ) <span style="color: green;">2</span>  <span style="color: red;">postoculars</span> | ( <span style="color: green;">8</span> ) 4–6 prefoveals| (9) 1– <span style="color: green;">2</span>  postfoveals| (10) <span style="color: red;">lacunolabial</span>  <span style="color: green;">absent</span> | ( <span style="color: green;">11</span> ) 4–5 interoculabials| (12) <span style="color: green;">7</span>  <span style="color: red;">temporals</span> | (13) 5– <span style="color: green;">8</span>  intersupraoculars| (14) 23–25 interrictals| (15) 4–5 gulars| (16) 16–18 lateral blotches of body| (17) 21– 22 anterior dorsals in females, 21 in male| (18) 21–23 midbody dorsals in females, 21 in male| (19) 17–19 posterior dorsals in females, 17 in male| (20) 177–182 ventrals in females, 176 in male| (21) 49–51 subcaudals in females, 53 in male| (22) <span style="color: green;">single</span>  <span style="color: red;">anal plate</span>  (BARBO et al. 2022)COMPARISONS: A summary of some meristic and morphometric characters is presented in Table 1. When compared with representatives of the B. jararaca species group, B. jabrensis sp. nov. presents a lower number of ventrals (176 in males| 177–182 in females), and it is distinguished from the B. jararaca from NC (184–219 in males| 188–220 in females), B. jararaca from SC (182– 202 in males| 188–208 in females), B. otavioi (182–191 in males| 185–194 in females), and B. sazimai (195–206 in males| 198–214 in females). The new species has also lower numbers of anterior dorsals and dorsals at midbody (21–22 and 21–23 scales, respectively), and it is distinguished from B. jararaca of SC (22–27 and 22–26), B. alcatraz (23–28 and 23–26), B. insularis (23–28 and 22–27), and B. otavioi (23–25 and 23–26). Additionally, the new species differs by the lower numbers of subcaudals (53 in males| 49–51 in females) from B. sazimai (63–69 in males| 54–65 in females), and by the grayish and brownish coloration from B. insularis (pale or yellowish coloration).The new species is easily distinguished from species included in the B. neuwiedi group (for a detailed description of the B. neuwiedi group see Silva and Rodrigues 2008) by the invariable grayish ground color of the body (versus a polychromatic and extremely variable background color in the B. neuwiedi species group). Additionally, the dorsum of the head in B. jabrensis sp. nov. presents irregular and undefined markings (versus well-defined markings in the B. neuwiedi group), the  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span>  and gulars display distinct and spotless light gray coloration (versus dark or strongly pigmented in most species of the B. neuwiedi group), the ground color of the  <span style="color: red;">venter</span>  is whitish and speckless (versus creamish and speckled in black in the B. neuwiedi group), and the lateral blotches of the body are similar to an inverted “V”, identical of those found in species included in the B. jararaca group (versus lateral blotches mostly trapezoidal or presenting a horseshoe pattern in the B. neuwiedi group).Bothrops jabrensis sp. nov. is possibly sympatric with Bothrops erythromelas Amaral, 1923 and Bothrops lutzi (Miranda-Ribeiro, 1915) (see the Discussion), although it can be easily distinguished from B. erythromelas by the higher number of dorsal scales at midbody (21–23 versus 19–21 in B. erythromelas) and the higher numbers of ventrals (176–182 versus 139–158) and subcaudals (49–53 versus 32–42). From B. lutzi, the new species differs by the absence of white blotches in the  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span>  higher number of ventrals (176 versus 161–173 in males| 177–182 versus 159–179 in females), and higher number of subcaudals (53 versus 40–50 in males| 49–51 versus 34–46 in females). (BARBO et al. 2022)COLOR IN LIFE: The color in life was grayish/brownish on dorsal surface with 16/17 lateral triangular/trapezoidal markings (saddles) that are irregularly defined, dark or brown–gray with well-defined borders, weakly light-grayish edged, opposite and alternate to each other in the middle of dorsum| dorsum of head grayish, with irregular and undefined dark-brown markings (Figs. 4A–4C)| postorbital stripe is dark brown, bordered below by a very thin light line. The postorbital stripe extends from behind the eye, covering superior portion of 7th and 8th  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span>  up to four scales long behind rictus oris, downwards to ventral direction| gular region mostly whitish–creamish, with  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span>  and symphysial finely speckled in gray| <span style="color: red;">venter</span>  mostly whitish, covering cloacal plate| tail grayish dorsally, covered with small dark gray lateral blotches, with subcaudals mostly whitish in ventral plan. (BARBO et al. 2022)<br>

(RATHEE et al. 2022)Comparisons: Based on the molecular data and hemipenis structure, Trimeresurus mayaae sp. nov. is found to be a member of subgenera Viridovipera. The species differs from all the known members of Viridovipera by following characters:Morphologically and meristically Trimeresurus mayaae sp. nov. closely resembles T. gumprechti, but differs from the latter by having rust coloured or greenish eye in males versus bright or deep red in T. gumprechti and green coloured eye in female versus golden yellow in T. gumprechti. Furthermore, Trimeresurus mayaae sp. nov. has 1–2 scales between internasal versus 0–1 in T. gumprechti.| ventral scales range 153–162 in Trimeresurus mayaae sp. nov. versus 162–168 T. gumprechti| <span style="color: red;">subcaudals</span>  <span style="color: green;">54–69</span>  in Trimeresurus mayaae sp. nov. versus 51–71 in T. gumprechti| TaL/TL in females 0.17 in Trimeresurus mayaae sp. nov. versus 0.14–0.16 in T. gumprechti. Trimeresurus mayaae sp. nov. differs from all the other members of subgenera Viridovipera by having rust coloured eye in males versus bright red or amber (rarely yellow) coloured in T. stejnegeri Schmidt, yellow or yellowish green in T. vogeli David, Vidal & Pauwels, green or yellowish green in T. medoensis Zhao, and bright or deep red in T. yunnanensis, and a green coloured eye in females versus yellow or amber in T. stejnegeri, yellow in T. vogeli and golden yellow in T. yunnanensis. A bicoloured (broad red above and thin white below) postocular streak is present in males of Trimeresurus mayaae sp. nov. versus white in T. stejnegeri, white, thin and faint in T. vogeli, no postocular streak in T. yunnanensis.

Gloydius lateralis	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis (and/or description): The above-mentioned specimens were identified as members of the genus Gloydius based on the small body size, bilateral pits, and divided subcaudal scales. G. lateralis sp. nov. differs from other congeneric species by a combination of the following characteristics: (1) relatively larger  <span style="color: red;">eyes</span> (ED/HL: <span style="color: green;">0.145–0.171</span>  n = 5)| (2) three  <span style="color: red;">palatine teeth</span> | ( <span style="color: green;">3</span> ) <span style="color: green;">20 or 21</span>  rows of  <span style="color: red;">midbody dorsal scales</span> | (4) <span style="color: red;">ventrals</span>  <span style="color: green;">151–163</span> (n = 9)| (5) <span style="color: red;">subcaudals</span>  <span style="color: green;">38–49</span> (n = 6)| (6) dorsal body laurel green or light brown with four rows of zigzag, dark brown patches, the medial two rows separated from each other by alternate phyllotaxis pattern in background color| (7) continuous, regular  <span style="color: green;">greyish-brown</span>  <span style="color: red;">ventrolateral stripe</span>  on each side of body and tail. (Zhang et al. 2022)Comparisons: Compared to other species in the genus Gloydius, G. lateralis sp. nov. has continuous, regular  <span style="color: green;">greyish-brown</span>  and pale, greyish-white ventrolateral stripes on both sides (vs disconnected white upper bordered ventrolateral stripes in G. qinlingensis and G. liupanensis| lacking the ventrolateral stripes in other congeneric species), and relatively larger  <span style="color: red;">eyes</span>  than the congeneric species (the ratio between the eye diameter and head length ranges from  <span style="color: green;">0.145–0.171</span>  in G. lateralis sp. nov. vs < 0.134 in others). Gloydius lateralis sp. nov. can be differentiated from the species in the G. blomhoffii group by having three  <span style="color: red;">palatine teeth</span> (vs four), from the G. halys complex by having  <span style="color: green;">20 or 21</span>  rows of  <span style="color: red;">midbody dorsal scales</span> (vs 22 or 23).For species in the G. strauchi group, Gloydius lateralis sp. nov. can be differentiated from G. monticola by having  <span style="color: green;">20 or 21</span>  rows of mid-body dorsal scales (vs 19 in G. monticola). Given the similar to G. angusticeps, G. lateralis sp. nov. can be differentiated from the latter by the larger  <span style="color: red;">eyes</span> (ED/HL  <span style="color: green;">0.145–0.171</span>  vs 0.104–0.119) and the ticker postorbital stripes. Additionally, the ventrolateral stripes sometimes appear in some other Gloydius species, such as G. qinlingensis and G. liupanensis, but G. lateralis sp. nov. differs from them by having the  <span style="color: red;">ventrolateral stripe</span>  lacking a white upper edge. Gloydius lateralis sp. nov. differs from G. strauchi, G. rubromaculatus, G. lipipengi, and G. huangi by the triangular head in dorsal view (vs spoon-shaped head).Gloydius swild is another species from Heishui, Aba, Sichuan (female holotype IVPP OV 2725 and paratype IVPP OV 2726) that is phylogenetically most closely related to G. lateralis sp. nov., but G. swild can be separated from the latter by significant branch lengths and p-distance (6.1%). G. lateralis sp. nov. differs from G. swild by having fewer  <span style="color: red;">ventrals</span>  <span style="color: green;">151–163</span> (n = 9) (vs 168–170, n = 2), laurel-green dorsal body with deep colored patches (vs dark, <span style="color: green;">greyish-brown</span>  background dorsal color), relatively larger  <span style="color: red;">eyes</span> (ED/HL 14.5–17.1%, n = 5 vs 11.5–13.4%, n = 2), the thicker postorbital stripes (2/ <span style="color: green;">3</span>  the width of the anterior temporal vs half the width of the anterior temporal), and the regular  <span style="color: green;">greyish-brown</span>  ventrolateral stripes (vs irregular ventrolateral stripes).

Snout elongate, flattened and rounded in dorsal view (Fig. 3C), rather rectangular in lateral view (Fig. 3E,F), with a very distinct and sharp canthus rostralis (SnL/HL 0.30, SnL/ED 1.92). Distance between eye and nostril 3.9 mm on both sides. Rostral slightly visible in dorsal aspect, triangular (Fig. 3C). Pupil vertically elliptical, loreal pit present, triangular in shape (Fig. 3E,F). Nostril completely enclosed in nasal scale| nasal scale partially fused with first supralabial (Fig. 3E). Shield bordering the anterior edge of loreal pit fused with second supralabial. Anterior subocular long, thin, and crescent-like, separated from the 4th and 5th supralabials by one row of scales| posterior subocular ovoid, separated from the 6th supralabial by 2/1 scales (Fig. 3E, F). Three preoculars on each side of the head| two upper preoculars located above the loreal pit, elongated, in contact with the single loreal which separates them from the nasal| lower preocular forming the lower margin of the loreal pit, lower preocular in contact with third supralabial (Fig. 3E, F). A small scale between the nasal and the scale formed by the fused second supralabial and loreal| 2/2 postoculars| 9/9 supralabials, third the largest (Fig. 3E,F)| 11/10 infralabials, those of the first pair in contact with each other behind the mental| the first three pairs of infralabials in contact with the single pair of chin shields (Fig. 3D). Six pairs of gulars aligned between the chin shields and the first preventral (Fig. 3D). One large pair of enlarged internasals, separated by three small scales. Three small slightly convex supraoculars, same size as or smaller than preoculars and postoculars (Fig. 3C). Scales on snout and in the interorbital region smooth, irregular, subimbricate| temporal and occipital scales moderately keeled (Fig. 3C,E,F). Dorsal scales in 17–17–15 rows. Dorsal scales all strongly keeled, except the first row, which is smooth (Fig. 3H). One preventral + 172 ventrals. Cloacal plate single| 61 subcaudals, all divided. Hemipenes long, papillose, and deeply forked with small, soft, basal spines (Fig. 3G). Each maxilla bearing a single large venom tooth| three teeth on palatine, 11 on pterygoid, and 12 on dentary. (IDIIATULLINA et al. 2023)Coloration in life (Figs 3–5). Dorsal surface of the head emerald-green with many scales partly or entirely dark red, especially on the snout, and on the interorbital, temporal and occipital regions (Fig. 3C). A reddish-brown postocular stripe extends from postocular scales to the neck (Fig. 3E,F). Black vertical pupil| iris olive-green with faded brown horizontal stripe (Fig. 3E,F). The background color of the dorsum emerald-green, similar to that of the head, with about 75 irregular, dark red cross-bands (Fig. 3A). These red bands are about two dorsal scales long mediodorsally, but getting narrower on the lower flanks where they are about 1–2 dorsal scale in length. At the level of the vertebral row, the red bands are generallyseparated by one dorsal scale. White vertebral spots present along the vertebral scale row, approximately every two or three scales (Fig. 3A). Ventrolateral stripe absent. Dark brown spots forming discontinuous pattern present on first to third lateral dorsal scale rows (Fig. 3H). Tail dark brown mottled with rusty spots. Ventral surface of the tail dark brown with white irregular bands, tail tip completely black. Infralabials greenish-white with faint brown spots (Fig. 3E,F)| the ventral surfaces of the head creamy white with bluish tint (Fig. 3D)| the ventral surfaces of body creamy white (Fig. 3B).In preservative the background dorsal color faded to greyish-brown, with less contrasting dark marks on the head and bands on the dorsum| the ventral color became whitish grey. (IDIIATULLINA et al. 2023)Variation: The main meristic and morphometric characters of the type series of Trimeresurus ciliaris sp. nov. are summarized in Table 4| color variation of the type series is presented in Figures 4, 5A, 6A–B, 7B–E. All members of the type series, similarly to the holotype, show a nasal scale partially fused with the first supralabial. Head scalation of the paratypes generally agrees with that of the holotype, however male ZMMU Re-17662 has a suboculars fused in a single long crescent-shaped scale (Fig. 4B), while the two males AUP-02011 (Fig. 4C) and ZMMU Re-17663 (Fig. 4D) have four small supraoculars on each side of the head instead of three as in the holotype. Coloration of paratypes is very similar to that of the holotype| all specimens have a creamy-white belly and lack ventrolateral stripe. Female specimen QSMI 1538 has slightly lower number of subcaudals than in males (SC 52 vs. 59–63). The white vertebral spots are present both in males and in females| they are regularly spaced by two or three vertebral scales. The number of dark bands on dorsum varies from 70 to 81 among the members of the type series, without apparent sexual dimorphism. Coloration of female specimen QSMI 1538 largely faded due to preservation in formalin for seven years. (IDIIATULLINA et al. 2023)Comparisons. The new species is morphologically and phylogenetically placed within the subgenus Trimeresurus (Malhotra and Thorpe 2004a| David et al. 2011) and morphologically is overall most similar to other limestone-dwelling pitviper species, including T. kanburiensis, T. kuiburi, and T. venustus s. str., so the comparisons with these three species appear to be the most pertinent. Trimeresurus ciliaris sp. nov. can be easily distinguished from other congeners by having: 17 midbody scale rows, three or four small supraocular scales, and a small scale between the nasal and the scale formed by the fused second supralabial and loreal. The main diagnostic characters separating Trimeresurus ciliaris sp. nov. from these three species are summarized in Table 5. The comparison of body coloration and head scalation of these species is presented in Figures 5 and 6, respectively. From the superficially similar Trimeresurus truongsonensis Orlov, Ryabov, Vu & Ho, a member of the subgenus Viridovipera, the new species can be easily distinguished by having a long papillose and deeply forked hemipenis (vs. short spinose hemipenis) and partially fused first supralabial and nasal scales (vs. separate).In particular, Trimeresurus ciliaris sp. nov. differs from T. kanburiensis by having: smaller maximal SVL (360 mm in male, 333 mm in female vs. 412 mm in male, 572 mm in female)| lower anterior number of dorsal scale rows (17 vs. 23, rarely 21 or 22)| lower number of midbody scale rows (17 vs. 19)| absence of dark lateral stripe on ventrals, Fig. 5A (vs. dark lateral stripe on ventrals always present, discontinuous, olive-brown, Fig. 5B)| three or four small supraocular scales, Fig. 6B (vs. single large supraocular scale, Fig. 6D)| body color in life (reddish-brown bands on an emerald-green background [Fig. 5A] vs. dark olive-brown bands on olive-greyish background [Fig. 5B])| white vertebral spots present in both sexes separated by 2–3 dorsal scales vs. white vertebral spots present only in males and are separated by 3–5 dorsal scales| iris color (olive-green with faded brown horizontal stripe [Fig. 6A] vs. brown, slightly golden [Fig. 6C])| and tail color (dark brown mottled with rusty spots vs. brownish-gray with olive-brown blotches).Trimeresurus ciliaris sp. nov. further differs from T. kuiburi by having: smaller maximal SVL in female (333 mm vs. 451 mm)| internasals separated by two or three scales (vs. always in contact)| lower anterior number of dorsal scale rows (17 vs. 21 rarely 23)| lower number midbody scale rows (17 vs. 19)| higher number of ventrals in females (172–175 vs. 164–166)| ventral surfaces of body creamy-white (vs. pale-green)| three or four small supraocular scales, Fig. 6A (vs. one large supraocular scale, Fig. 6F)| small scale between nasal and second supralabial present vs. absent| body color in life (reddish-brown bands on emerald-green background [Fig. 5A] vs. red to purple bands on bottle-green background [Fig. 5C])| white vertebral spots present in both sexes separated by 2–3 dorsal scales vs. white vertebral dots present only in males and are separated by 5–6 dorsal scales| iris color (olive-green with faded brown horizontal stripe [Fig. 6A] vs. copper [Fig. 6E])| and tail color (dark brown mottled with rusty spots vs. red with some thin lighter bands).Trimeresurus ciliaris sp. nov. can be further differentiated from T. venustus s. str. by having: smaller maximal SVL (360 mm in male, 333 mm in female vs. 490 mm in male, 456 mm in female)| lower anterior number of dorsal scale rows (17 vs. 23, rarely 21 or 25)| lower number midbody scale rows (17 vs. 21, rarely 19)| white vertebral spots present in both sexes separated by 2–3 dorsal scales (vs. absent)| ventral surfaces creamy-white (vs. pale-green)| lateral dark stripe on ventrals absent (vs. lateral dark stripe on ventrals always present, discontinuous, red)| three or four small supraocular scales, Fig. 6A (vs. one large supraocular scale, Fig. 6H)| small scale between nasal and second supralabial present vs. absent| body color in life (reddish-brown bands on emerald-green background [Fig. 5A] vs. red to purple bands on dark bottle-green background [Fig. 5D])| white vertebral spots present in both sexes separated by 2–3 dorsal scales vs. white vertebral dots absent in both sexes| iris color (olive-green with faded brown horizontal stripe [Fig. 6A] vs. yellowish-brown to gold [Fig. 6G])| and tail coloration (dark brown mottled with rusty spots vs. brown with dark purplish-brown crossbars).Among the other species in the subgenus Trimeresurus, the new species can be readily distinguished from T. albolabris, T. andersonii, T. cantori, T. cardamomensis, T. caudornatus, T. davidi, T. erythrurus, T. fasciatus, T. guoi, T. honsonensis, T. insularis, T. labialis, T. macrops, T. mutabilis, T. purpureomaculatus, T. rubeus, T. salazar, and T. septentrionalis by body coloration and pattern (reddish-brown bands on emerald-green background in the new species vs. uniform green or green coloration with no pattern, or pattern consisting of small brownish spots or speckles in other species, or straw-yellow background with irregular, dark-brown transverse body bands in T. honsonensis). Moreover, by having 17 MSR, the new species can be further separated from T. albolabris (21 MSR), T. andersonii (21 MSR), T. cantori (27, 29 or 31 MSR), T. cardamomensis (21 MSR), T. caudornatus (21 MSR), T. davidi (21 or 23 MSR), T. erythrurus (23 rarely 21, 25 MSR), T. fasciatus (21 MSR), T. guoi (21 MSR), T. honsonensis (21 MSR), T. insularis (21 MSR), T. labialis (21 or 23 MSR), T. macrops (21 MSR), T. mutabilis (21 MSR), T. purpureomaculatus (25 rarely 27, 29 MSR), T. rubeus (21 MSR), T. salazar (21 MSR), and T. septentrionalis (21 MSR) (see Gumprecht et al. 2004| Grismer et al. 2008| Malhotra et al. 2011| Chandramouli et al. 2020| Chen et al. 2020, 2021| Mirza et al. 2020| our data).

We summarize in table 2 the main characters separating Trimeresurus uetzi sp. nov. from the other twelve species of the complex of Trimeresurus albolabris-septentrionalis. More specifically, the comparisons with these species are as follows:Trimeresurus uetzi sp. nov. is distinguished from T. albolabris sensu stricto (restricted to southern China, northern Vietnam and central laos) by having: (1) hemipenes short, reaching only the 6th–8th SC vs. reaching the 15th–18th SC in T. albolabris| (2) higher mean number of ventral scales (163.27 ± 5.61 in males, 164.14 ± 3.84 in females vs. 154.93 ± 4.67 in males, 158.80 ± 4.78 in females, respectively)| (3) greater mean total numbers of ventral scales plus subcaudals in males (230.4 ± 7.88 vs. 218.00 ± 11.04)| (4) no small scale between the nasal and the pit vs. one or two small scales usually present| and (5) postocular streak paler and wider covering 2–3 scales in males vs. thinner, covering 1–2 scales. Furthermore, T. uetzi sp. nov. is widely separated from T. albolabris sensu stricto on a geographical basis as this latter species inhabits only south-eastern China, northern Vietnam and central laos. Moreover, the ranges of both species are separated by that of Trimeresurus guoi.Trimeresurus uetzi sp. nov. is distinguished from T. caudornatus by having: (1) tip of hemipenes reaching the 6th–8th SC vs. 37th–38th SC| (2) postocular stripe present in males vs. absent| (3) ventrolateral body stripe present, white, conspicuous vs. faint, greenish-yellow, poorly contrasted| (4) in life, iris copper in male vs. golden yellow in male| and (5) no median stripe on the lower surface of the tail vs. an irregular, red-orange stripe in the middle of the ventral surface present.Trimeresurus uetzi sp. nov. is distinguished from T. guoi by having: (1) hemipenes reaching the 6th–8th SC vs. the 23rd–32nd SC| (2) ventrolateral stripes present in males and often in females vs. absent in both sexes| (3) a postocular stripe present in males vs. absent| and (4) in life, iris copper in male vs. firebrick-red or deep red in male.Trimeresurus uetzi sp. nov. is distinguished from T. salazar by having: (1) hemipenes reaching the 6th–8th SC vs. 12th–13th SC| (2) postocular streak white vs. bicolor (red and white)| (3) ventrolateral stripe white vs. stripe bicolor (red and white)| and (4) lower total numbers of ventral scales and subcaudals in females 216.08 ± 3.99 vs. 227.33 ± 3.79.Trimeresurus uetzi sp. nov. is distinguished from T. septentrionalis sensu stricto, restricted to western and central Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India, two species previously largely confused, by having: (1) lower total of ventral scales and subcaudals (230.4 ± 7.88 in males, 216.08 ± 3.99 in females vs. 241.67 ± 7.76 in males, 231.79 ± 3.68 in females of T. septentrionalis)| (2) white postocular streak wide and conspicuous, covering 2–3 scales in males vs. usually absent or thin and pale, covering 1 scale| and (3) in life, eye copper in male vs. yellowish-green in male.
