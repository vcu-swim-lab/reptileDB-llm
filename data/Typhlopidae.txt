It differs from Grypotyphlops in lacking subocular scales. It differs from Asiatyphlops, Cyclotyphlops, Malayotyphlops, Indotyphlops, and Xerotyphlops in having more total scale rows (466 versus 294–367, averages). It differs from other genera except Indotyphlops in having a thin body (TL/MBD = 55.8 versus 35.1–46.6 in those other genera; averages). It differs from Sundatyphlops and Ramphotyphlops in having relatively short tails (TL/TA = 49.7 versus 31.8–33.3). [HEDGES et al. 2014: 33]. For an alternative diagnosis see PYRON & WALLACH 2014: 61.Diagnosis (australis): A dark, moderately large, stout blind-snake with snout rounded in profile, 22 midbody scale rows, nasal cleft usually proceeding from second labial and extending up to about midway between nostril and rostral, the top of cleft curving forwards (Storr 1981).Color: Dorsal and dorsolateral surfaces purplish-black in adults (purplish-pink in juveniles), lower surfaces whitish; boundary between dark and pale coloration jagged, owing to lateral scales being either wholly dark or wholly pale.Description: Waite 1918: 28
Anilios batillus	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Description: Head sub-acute, much produced; snout acutely rounded; nostrils lateral. close to the rostral to which the cleft is continued, dividing the nasal: rostral very long, one-third longer than broad. extending to the level of the eyes, widest infront, its width nearly half that of the head, the lower part broader than long; diameter of body 53 times in its length.

Anilios bituberculatus	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: A moderately dark, moderately small, slender, long-snouted blind-snake with snout strongly trilobed (as seen from above) and slightly angular in profile, 20 midbody scale rows and nasal cleft proceeding from second labial (from Storr 1981).Description: Waite 1918: 27
Indotyphlops braminus	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: First, I. braminus is found in regions where there is no other blind snake.Second, the condition of the nasal sutures can separate I. braminus from all but five scolecophidian species. In I. braminus the inferior or infranasal suture (INS) from the nostril (N) curves downward and contacts the preocular (PO), rather than the first or second supralabial (SL1 or SL2) as in most other typhlopids, whereas the superior or supranasal suture (SNS) extends upwards and backwards onto the top of the snout and makes contact with the rostral (R) to completely divide the nasal shield (rather than not extending onto dorsum of snout and not contacting the rostral as in most other typhlopids) (Fig. 1). The supranasal suture extends onto the dorsum of the snout and contacts the rostral in only three other species (Anilios erycinus of New Guinea, A. ganei and A. ligatus of western Australia) and the infranasal suture contacts the preocular in only two other species (Indotyphlops lankaensis and I. violaceus of Sri Lanka). Among these five problematic species, they differ from Indotyphlops braminus in having the following distinctions: Anilios erycinus of New Guinea has the INS contacting SL1 (vs. PO), more postoculars (2 vs. 1), a narrower rostral (0.15 vs. 0.30–0.40 head width), and is larger in size (LOA > 230 mm vs. < 200 mm); A. ganei of Australia has the INS in contact with SL2 (vs. PO), SNS invisible dorsally (vs. visible), more scale rows (24 vs. 20), more middorsals (> 440 vs. < 310), and a larger body size (> 235 mm vs. < 200 mm); A. micromma of Australia has the INS contacting SL 2 (vs. PO), fewer scale rows (18 vs. 20), more middorsals (493 vs. < 370), more postoculars (3 vs. 1), and a broader rostral (0.5 vs. 0.3–0.4 head width); I. lankaensis of Sri Lanka has the SNS invisible dorsally (vs. visible), fewer middorsals (< 261 vs. > 261), and a thicker body (L/W < 35 vs. > 30); I. violaceus of Sri Lanka has the SNS invisible dorsally (vs. visible). With the exceptions just noted for the above five species, the nasal suture condition of I. braminus will differentiate it from all of the other 475 scolecophidian species.Third, the head of I. braminus exhibits prominent and distinct subcutaneous sebaceous glands arranged in rows beneath each head shield (also present in the I. pammeces species group). These gland lines run parallel to and along the margins of the anterior head shields. A unique situation involves the gland lines of the prenasal or anterior nasal (N1) shield and the median rostral (R) shield. As the gland line on the lower or anterior rostral (ARL) ascends towards the top of the snout it is interrupted by the supranasal gland line (SNL) on the prenasal (N1) shield, which is confluent with the gland line along the posterior rostral (PRL). A close inspection of the head will clearly reveal this condition and it is unique among all scolecophidians. This one feature will positively identify I. braminus. Another unusual gland line feature, also visible without the aid of a microscope, is that the posterior rostral (R) and supranasal (N2) shields have a bowlike gland line (CGL) that is convex rather than concave and parallel to the posterior rostral border. This unique feature on the top of the head just anterior to the level of the eyes is distinct and easily visible. These two features, 1) a continuous line of whitish glands extending along the nasal suture (SNL) and posterior rostral (PRL), and 2) a convexly curved gland line (CGL) across the posterior rostral (R) and supranasal (N2) shields, will positively identify I. braminus in an examination or photographs (figs. 1–2).Fourth, in spite of the fact that the colour in I. braminus ranges from jet black through all shades of brown to tan and pink, it has a lighter colored snout with a white chin, cloacal region, and tail tip (from Wallach 2020, see figures there).

Dark upper surfaces gradually merging with pale lower surfaces.
Anilios leptosoma	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: A moderately long, slender Anilios to about 400 mm total length. Distinguished from all other Anilios by a combination of midbody scales in 16 rows, dorsal body scales 583–781, snout in profile prominent with obtusely angular horizontal edge, snout rounded and weakly trilobed in dorsal view, nasal cleft originating from second supralabial, extending anteriorly to nostril and terminating at rostral scale, presence of a terminal tail spine and lack of any black colouration on head, body or tail [Ellis et al. 2017].Color: Snout horn-coloured. Remaining dorsal surfaces purplish-brown, gradually becoming paler ventrally.Comparison with other species. Anilios leptosoma can be distinguished from all but three Anilios species (A. longissimus, A. minimus and A. nema) by its slender elongate body and low MBSR counts (16 vs 18, 20, 22 or 24) which does not differ within any species of the genus. Of the remaining three Anilios species with 16 MBSR (A. longissimus, A. minimus and A. nema), A. leptosoma can be distinguished by the termination point of nasal cleft at rostral completely dividing the nasal scale (vs terminating at nostril in A. longissimus and A. minimus, or midway between nostril and rostral in A. nema), higher number of dorsal body scale rows (583–781 vs 381–457 in A. minimus and 520–589 in A. nema) and a less depressed head in comparison to A. longissimus.Within its distribution, A. leptosoma is most similar in general appearance to A. systenos sp. nov., A. obtusifrons sp. nov. and A. grypus; however, it is easily diagnosed by the low MBSR (16 vs 18 in A. systenos sp. nov., A. obtusifrons sp. nov. and A. grypus) and a combination of absence of a hooked beak (vs distinct hook in A. grypus), termination point of the nasal cleft at the rostral scale (midway between nostril and rostral in A. obtusifrons sp. nov.) and absence of any black pigment on the head or tail (vs black pigment on head and/or tail in A. grypus) [Ellis et al. 2017].

Species of Ramphotyphlops have (1) eye, distinct (rarely indistinct), (2) snout, rounded or beaked, (3) head scale arrangement, non-circular, (4) frontorostral, absent, (5) nasal, completely or incompletely divided, (6) nasal suture origin, supralabial 2 (sometimes 1 or 1/2 suture), (7) suboculars or subpreoculars, absent (rarely present), (8) postoculars, 2–3 (rarely 1; average, 2.15), (9) preocular-labial contact, supralabials 2–3 (rarely 3 only or fused with ocular or nasal), (10) midbody scale rows, 18–30 (average, 21.7), (11) scale row reduction, pres- ent or absent, (12) total scale rows, 206–653 (average, 419), (13) caudals, 8–36 (average, 19.8), (14) maximum total length, 117–480 (average, 302) mm, (15) total length/midbody diameter, 18–91.5 (average, 48.8), (16) total length/ tail length, 16.7–70 (average, 31.8), (17) dorsal color, usually dark brown (sometimes medium brown, tan, gray, or purplish), (18) ventral color, usually cream or yellowish-white (sometimes gray-green, pinkish, tan, or brown), (19) dorsum darker than venter, (20) overall, usually either patternless or with longitudinal lines (Tables 1–2); molecular phylogenetic support (Fig. 1).Ramphotyphlops is part of a larger, more inclusive clade (Ramphotyphlops s.l.) that shares a solid, awn-like protrusible hemipenis and retrocloacal sacs (Robb 1966; McDowell 1974), although not all species have been examined for those traits. Presumably these characters distinguish it from other genera in the Asiatyphlopinae, except those three genera formerly in Ramphotyphlops s.l. and thus the closest relatives of Ramphotyphlops s.s.: Acutotyphlops, Anilios, and Sundatyphlops. From Acutotyphlops, Ramphotyphlops can be distinguished by lacking a frontorostral scale. From Anilios, it can be distinguished by its smaller maximum size (mean among species, 302 versus 354 mm TL), higher mean number of midbody scales (21.7 versus 20.1), and longer tails (TL/TA = 31.8 versus 49.7; averages). From Sundatyphlops, it can be distinguished by its smaller maximum size (302 versus 395 mm TL; only R. angusticeps, 455 mm TL, has a greater maximum size) [HEDGES et al. 2014: 39]. For an alternative diagnosis see PYRON & WALLACH 2014: 57.

Grypotyphlops acutus	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis (genus). Species of Grypotyphlops have (1) eye, distinct or indistinct, (2) snout, beaked, (3) head scale arrangement, non-circular, (4) frontorostral, absent, (5) nasal, completely or incompletely divided, (6) nasal suture origin, 2nd supralabial, (7) suboculars or subpreoculars, present, (8) postoculars, 4 (rarely 3 or 5; average, 4.0), (9) preocular-labial contact, supralabials 2 & 3, (10) midbody scale rows, 24–30, (11) scale row reduction, present, (12) total scale rows, 448–526 (average, 487), (13) caudals, 7–13 (average, 10.0), (14) maximum total length, 630 mm, (15) total length/midbody diameter, 30–66 (average, 48.0), (16) total length/tail length, 17–133 (average, 75.1), (17) dorsal color, gray, brown, or golden brown, (18) ventral color, grayish-white, yellow, or pale brown, (19) dorsum darker than venter, (20) overall, coloration is uniform, although pale scale centers may appear as weakly-defined lines (Tables 1–2); no molecular phylogenetic information is available.From other genera of Asiatyphlopinae except Acutotyphlops and Cyclotyphlops, Grypotyphlops differs in having subocular scales (versus absent). Grypotyphlops differs from Acutotyphlops in lacking a frontorostral and from Cyclotyphlops in having non-circular head scales (versus circular arrangement). Although one species of Xe- rotyphlops has a subocular scale, Grypotyphlops differs from that genus in having more postoculars (3–5 versus 2), more midbody scale rows (29 versus 23.5, averages), and more total scale rows (448–526 versus 206–435). At 630 mm TL, Grypotyphlops also stands out in its large size [HEDGES et al. 2014].  For an alternative diagnosis see PYRON & WALLACH 2014: 52.

Rhinotyphlops boylei	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Description in BROADLEY & WALLACH 2009.
Letheobia caeca	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis (genus): Letheobia is comprised of the clade stemming from the most recent common ancestor of Typhlops leucostictus and the Rhinotyphlops newtonispecies group. This includes Roux-Estève’s (1974) Typhlops Groups II and V plus  Rhinotyphlops Groups IV, V, VI and VII, which is equivalent to the Letheobia clade of species examined by Wallach 1998 (PhD thesis, Northeastern University, Boston). For an alternative diagnosis see PYRON & WALLACH 2014: 50.Diagnosis (genus). Species of Letheobia have (1) eye, indistinct, (2) snout, beaked or rounded, (3) head scale arrangement, non-circular, (4) frontorostral, absent, (5) nasal, completely or incompletely divided, (6) nasal suture origin, 2nd supralabial (rarely, 1st supralabial, suture (1/2), rostral, or preocular), (7) suboculars or subpreoculars, present (rarely absent), (8) postoculars, 3–4 (rarely 2, 5–7; average, 3.55), (9) preocular-labial contact, supralabials 2 & 3 (sometimes 2nd, 3rd, 2–4, or none), (10) midbody scale rows, 18–30 (average 22.3), (11) scale row reduction, present or absent, (12) total scale rows, 250–737 (average, 484), (13) caudals, 8–15 (average, 11.1), (14) maximum total length, 135–670 (average, 350) mm, (15) total length/midbody diameter, 35–129 (average, 66.6), (16) total length/tail length, 45.5–143 (average, 79.0), (17) dorsal color, usually pale (pink, cream, white, colorless), (18) ventral color, usually pale (pink, cream, white, unpigmented), (19) dorsum same color as venter, and (20) overall, apatternless, unicolor snake (Tables 1–2); molecular phylogenetic support (Fig. 1).From Afrotyphlops and Rhinotyphlops, Letheobia is distinguished by having an indistinct eye (versus distinct), having subocular scales present (versus absent), and having a pale (versus dark) dorsum. [HEDGES et al. 2014: 30]Characters: The nomenclature of supralabial imbrication patterns (SIP) follows Wallach (1993), except that “X” indicates no supralabial overlaps a superior head shield, II–P amd II–O indicate second supralabial overlapping preocular and ocular, respectively, and S and PO represent the subocular and postocular, respectively. Scale rows were counted as follows: mid-dorsals (MD) between the rostral shield and the apical spine; longitudinal scale rows (SR) at three points: first (A) at level of 20th midventral scale caudad of mental; second (B) at midbody (MSR) and third (C) at 10th scale craniad of vent. Scale row reductions between points A–B and B–C were then recorded. The ratios of middorsals/vertebrae (MD/V from Roux-Estève 1974) and total length/midbody diameter (L/D) were calculated.The western population (L. caecus) from Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon and Congo-Brazzaville has 22 scale rows, a papillate rostral shield, and supranasals extending beyond the rostral. The eastern population (L. acutirostratus Andersson 1916) from the Democratic Republic of the Congo has 24-26 scale rows, a granular rostral, and supranasals not extending beyond the rostral (WALLACH 2005).Another perplexing specimen (MZUF 32387) from eastern Congo has 26 midbody scale rows, a granular hourglass rostral, a small frontal not in contact with the short supranasals, and the inferior nasal suture contacting the second infralabial. The types of the above species and their synonyms (Typhlops avakubae Schmidt 1923 and Typhlops caecus pitmani Witte 1961) must be examined [...] (WALLACH 2005).

Rhinotyphlops leucocephalus	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Original description: “Snout very prominent, slightly hooked in profile, with an angular horizontal keel and lateral nostrils. Rostral large, nearly half as wide as the head, extending to the level of the anterior borders of the eyes, which are distinguishable; nasal incompletely divided, the suture proceeding from the second upper labial; preocular present, much narrower than either the nasal or the ocular, in contact with the second and third upper labials; four upper labials, the last very large; no subocular; nasals separated on the top of the head; upper head-scales slightly enlarged; twenty-four scales round the middle of the body. Diameter of body contained forty-three times in the total length; tail broader than long, terminating in a short spine. Plumbeous above, the lateral borders of the scales black, producing a striped effect, which becomes more pronounced caudad. Head and lower surfaces uniform white; the line of demarcation between the upper and lower surfaces sharply defined, but forming very irregular line.Total length 212 mm.; tail 3 mm.This species appears to be more closely allied to the Malagasy T. boettgeri, Boulenger, than to any African form; it differs, however, in its more strongly hooked snout, broader head, smaller rostral, and colour. Its nearest African relatives appear to be T. mossambicus (Peters) and T. punctatus (Leach), from both of which it differs in its more strongly marked horizontal rostral keel, the origin of the nasal suture from the second, instead of the first, upper labial, and the more slender bodily form.” (Parker 1930)

There appears to be no eyes. Superior labials three. This genus is between Typhlops and Helminthophis Peters, differing from the latter in its erect nasal plate, with nostril on the superior suture. The Onychocephalus caecus Duméril, from Gaboon, appears to belong to this genus;Comparisons: the two species may be distinguished as follows: Muzzle obtuse; rostral very wide, largely in contact with the superciliary plates; nasal large: L. pallida. Muzzle transversely acute ; rostral not reaching to superciliaries; nasal minute: L. caeca.Specific characters: Rostral subquadrate viewed from above, nearly as broad as long, in contact nearly equally with three scales above the fronto-nasals, viz., the frontal and two superciliaries. The subocular a little larger than the ocular; behind these a series of seven scales from the rictus to the median row, on each side. Preocular and fronto-nasal of equal width, the latter sending a very narrow point to the second labial behind the wider nasal. Nostril very near the rostral suture. Tail as long as width of head, acuminate. Scales equal, in twenty-two longitudinal rows. Form quite slender. Length 6 in. 3.5 lines diameter at middle 1.25 lines.

Indotyphlops ahsanai	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: Typhlops ahsanai belongs to madgemintonai Group, differing in having 75% complete supranasal suture; anterior nasal scale over- laps the first supralabial and anterior ventral part of the posterior nasal scale; the posterior nasal scale is deeply scalloped behind so that the preocular scale extends deep in the postnasal concavity so formed; preocular scale is larger than ocular; the preocular- nasal suture is studded with thick squamous glands; preocular scale is in contact with only third supra- labial; posterior nasal scale is in contact with second and third supralabial.
Madatyphlops arenarius	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis (genus). Species of Madatyphlops have (1) eye, distinct, (2) snout, rounded, (3) head scale arrangement, non-circular, (4) frontorostral, absent, (5) nasal, incompletely (sometimes completely) divided, (6) nasal suture origin, supralabial 2, (7) suboculars or subpreoculars, absent, (8) postoculars, 2–3 (rarely 1 or 4; average, 2.27), (9) preocular-labial contact, supralabials 2 & 3, (10) midbody scale rows, 20–28 (average, 22.9), (11) scale row reduction, present or absent, (12) total scale rows, 252–600 (average, 429), (13) caudals, 6–18 (average, 11.2), (14) maximum total length, 176–600 (average, 320) mm, (15) total length/midbody diameter, 27–85 (average, 45.6), (16) total length/tail length, 33–125 (average, 53.7), (17) dorsal color, usually brown but variable (sometimes white, pink, cream, yellow, gray), (18) ventral color, variable (white, pink, cream, yellow, gray, brown), (19) dorsum darker than venter, (20) overall, usually patternless (rarely with line or yellow nuchal collar) (Tables 1–2); molecular phylo- genetic support (Fig. 1).Madatyphlops is distinguished from all genera of Afrotyphlopinae in having fewer postocular scales (2.27 versus 3.68), fewer midbody scales (22.9 versus 24.8), smaller body size (320 versus 403 mm TL), and longer tails (TL/TA = 53.7 versus 68.2; averages). It is distinguished from all genera of Typhlopinae in having more postocular scales (2.27 versus 1.66), more midbody scales (22.9 versus 20.3), more total scale rows (429 versus 369; averages), and larger body size (320 versus 264 mm TL). Madatyphlops is distinguished from individual genera of Asiaty- phlopinae in the following ways: Acutotyphlops has a frontorostral and complete nasal division (versus absent, and suture incomplete), Cyclotyphlops has a circular arrangement of head scales (versus non-circular), Grypotyphlops has suboculars present (versus absent), Indotyphlops has 1 postocular (versus 2–3), Asiatyphlops, Malayotyphlops, and Xerotyphlops have fewer average total scale rows (339, 367, and 355 versus 429), Ramphotyphlops and Sunda- typhlops have longer tails (TL/TA = 31.8 and 33.3 versus 53.7; averages), and Anilios has a solid, awn-like protrusible hemipenis and retrocloacal sacs (versus non-protrusible hemipenis and retrocloacal sacs absent). Xenotyphlop- idae (Xenotyphlops) also occurs on Madagascar, but it differs from Madatyphlops in having a circular rostral scale and single enlarged anal shield (Vidal et al. 2010) [HEDGES et al. 2014: 42].

Afrotyphlops bibronii	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Description in BROADLEY & WALLACH 2009.
Cubatyphlops biminiensis	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis (genus). Species of Cubatyphlops have (1) eye, distinct, (2) snout, rounded, (3) head scale arrangement, non-circular, (4) frontorostral, absent, (5) nasal, completely divided (rarely incomplete), (6) nasal suture origin, supralabial 2, (7) suboculars or subpreoculars, absent, (8) postoculars, 1 (rarely 2; average 1.0), (9) preocular-labial contact, supralabials 2 & 3 (rarely none), (10) midbody scale rows, 20–24 (average, 22.1), (11) scale row reduction, present or absent, (12) total scale rows, 351–629 (average, 503), (13) caudals, 22, (14) maximum total length, 197– 460 (average, 304) mm, (15) total length/midbody diameter, 36–75 (average, 54.7), (16) total length/tail length, 29–85 (average, 50.4), (17) dorsal color, brown (sometimes unpigmented, pinkish), (18) ventral color, unpigmented (pinkish) or rarely cream, (19) dorsum darker than venter, (20) overall, lacking any distinctive pattern (spots, lines, or stripes) (Tables 1–2); molecular phylogenetic support (Figs. 1, 3).This genus is distinguished from the other two major genera inhabiting the Caribbean islands, Antillotyphlops and Typhlops, in that the preocular contacts supralabials 2 and 3, and one postocular is present (versus preocular contact with supralabial 3 only, and the presence of two postoculars) (Thomas 1968; 1976; Dixon & Hendricks 1979; Thomas & Hedges 2007). Species in this genus also stand out among closely related genera in being unusually thin, with individuals of all species except one having TL/MBD ratios above 50, being unusually long (up to 460 mm TL), and in having an unusually high number of total scale rows (to 629). Although Cubatyphlops can be distinguished from its closely related genera, it is more difficult to separate it from the primarily mainland New World genus Amerotyphlops. It shares with that genus the preocular contact with supralabials 2 and 3, and, in some species of Amerotyphlops, the presence of a single postocular. However, it can be nearly completely distinguished from the mainland genus in having a high number of total scale rows, minimally 453 in 11 of the 12 species (C. caymanensis, 351–408); in Amerotyphlops, the maximum number of total scale rows is 441, except in one species, A. microstomus (487–556). Concerning the two overlap species, C. caymanensis is separated from Amerotyphlops in the molecular phylogeny, and A. microstomus is separated from Cubatyphlops in having 2 postoculars instead of one postocular. Also, 8 of the 14 species of Amerotyphlops can be distinguished from Cubatyphlops in having either an incompletely divided nasal scale (A. minuisquamus, A. paucisquamus, and A. reticulatus, and A. yonenagae) or a patterned (lines or spots) dorsum and/or head (A. brongersmianus, A. minuisquamus, A. paucisquamus, A. reticulatus, A. tasymicris, A. tenuis, A. trinitatus, and A. yonenagae) or both. In Cubatyphlops, the nasal is completely divided and they have no distinct pattern [HEDGES et al. 2014: 45].Diagnosis: Typhlops biminiensis sensu stricto is one of the largest West Indian species of Typhlops, TL (total  length) to 370 mm. The preocular contacts supralabials 2 and 3, which is a characteristic of the T. biminiensis  Group (Richmond, 1955; Thomas, 1968) of West Indian species. This feature also occurs in all mainland Central and South American species (Dixon & Hendricks, 1979) but not most West Indian species, which belong  to another West Indian radiation of Typhlops, the major Antillean radiation (MAR) (Thomas, 1976). Aside  from the preocular-contact character, T. biminiensis is distinguished from members of the MAR by its broadly  angled preocular (93–125°) and its broad rostral scale (RW1/RL1 0.81–1.08). The only currently recognized  member of the Major Antillean Radiation occurring within the range of T. biminiensis is T. lumbricalis of  Cuba and the Great and Little Bahama Bank islands. From described members of the Typhlops biminiensis  group (T. caymanensis, T. epactius, and T. paradoxus), T. biminiensis sensu stricto differs in its larger size and  broad, nearly round, rostral scale (Fig. 8A) with RW1/RL1 values of over 0.81. It further differs from T. caymanensis by its greater number of scale rows (24 or 22 initially versus 20 rows for T. caymanensis) and  greater number of middorsal scales (454–537 versus 351–408). From the Cuban species (Fig. 8) it differs in  having a larger rostral size (RW1+RL3; Fig. 10A), longer snout (NE; Fig. 10B), and smaller preocular apical  diameter (PD; Fig. 10C). Because the new Cuban species can thus be distinguished from T. biminiensis, T.  caymanensis, T. epactius, and T. paradoxus, our discussion below will focus mostly on diagnostic traits  among the Cuban species previously confused with T. biminiensis.
Afrotyphlops blanfordii	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Description in BROADLEY & WALLACH 2009.
Argyrophis bothriorhynchus	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Description: rounded, strongly projecting; nostrils lateral. Rostral narrow, its upper portion about 1/3 the width of the head, extending to the level of the eyes; nasal nearly completely divided, the lower cIeft passing to the 2nd labial; ocular, preocular, and posterior nasal subequal in length; eye very distinct, in the ocular shield, the lower edge of which is wedged in between 3rd and 4th labials; prefrontal in contact with the rostral. A distinct but shallow depression on each side of the snout, below the nostril, the nasal cIeft passing through it: tail ending in a small spine; 24 scales round the body, the diameter of which is contained 30 timesin the total length; 300-330 transverse rows of scales (Smith 1943: 53).Coloration: Brown above, paler below (Smith 1943: 53).
Amerotyphlops brongersmianus	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis (genus). Species of Amerotyphlops have (1) eye, distinct or indistinct, (2) snout, rounded, (3) head scale arrangement, non–circular, (4) frontorostral, absent, (5) nasal, completely or incompletely divided, (6) nasal suture origin, supralabial 2 (sometimes 1 or 1/2 suture), (7) suboculars or subpreoculars, absent (rarely present), (8) pos- toculars, 1–2 (rarely 3–4, average, 1.69), (9) preocular–labial contact, supralabials 2 & 3, (10) midbody scale rows, 16–22 (average, 19.1), (11) scale row reduction, absent (rarely present), (12) total scale rows, 170–556 (average, 327), (13) caudals, 6–15 (average, 9.4), (14) maximum total length, 101–522 (average, 287) mm, (15) total length/ midbody diameter, 16–77 (average, 38.7), (16) total length/tail length, 23–270 (average, 66.8), (17) dorsal color, brown or yellow, (18) ventral color, white, cream, or yellow, (19) dorsum darker than venter, (20) overall color pat- tern often consists of spots, lines, reticulations, and/or a band over region of eyes (Tables 1–2); molecular phyloge- netic support (Figs. 1, 3).This genus is distinguished from two other genera of the subfamily Typhlopinae, Antillotyphlops and Typhlops, in that the preocular contacts supralabials 2 and 3 (versus preocular contact with supralabial 3 only) (Thomas 1968; 1976; Dixon & Hendricks 1979; Thomas & Hedges 2007). Although Amerotyphlops can be distinguished from those genera, it is more difficult to separate it from the primarily Cuban genus Cubatyphlops. It shares with that genus the preocular contact with supralabials 2 and 3, and presence of a single postocular in some species. However, it can be nearly completely distinguished from Cubatyphlops in total scale rows: there are minimally 453 in 11 of the 12 species of that genus (C. caymanensis, 351–408) whereas in Amerotyphlops, the maximum number of total scale rows is 441, except in one species, A. microstomus (487–556). Concerning the two overlap species, C. caymanensis is separated from Amerotyphlops in the molecular phylogeny, and A. microstomus is separated from Cubatyphlops in having 2 postoculars instead of 1 postocular. Also, 8 of the 14 species of Amerotyphlops can be distinguished from Cubatyphlops in having either an incompletely divided nasal scale (A. minuisquamus, A. paucis- quamus, A. reticulatus, and A. yonenagae) or a patterned (lines or spots) dorsum and/or head (A. brongersmianus, A. minuisquamus, A. paucisquamus, A. reticulatus, A. tasymicris, A. tenuis, A. trinitatus, and A. yonenagae) or both. In Cubatyphlops, the nasal is completely divided and there is no distinct pattern [HEDGES et al. 2014: 43]. For an alternative diagnosis see PYRON & WALLACH 2014: 45.Diagnosis (species). A slightly large species (maximum total length 325 mm) with 11 dorsal scale rows pigmented brown, yellowish brown or reddish brown, snout frequently streaked with dark brown along scale edges; dorsal pigment frequently concentrated near center of scale but occasionally diffuse, tending to appear spotted, reticulated, or lined; nasal cleft incomplete; scale rows usually without reduction (96%), 20­-20-­20 (rarely 20­-20-­19 or 20­-20-­18); dorsal scales from rostral to tail spine average 232 (Dixon & Hendricks 1979: 11).

Indotyphlops fletcheri	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Original description: “Specimens of a Typhlops very like braminus [...] differ however from braminus, in that the suture below the nostrils passes to the 2nd labial instead of to the prœocular. Although this is the only difference I can find, it is sufficiently important, I think, to claim for this the rank of a species apart from braminus. Of the hosts of true braminus I have examined I have never met with a specimen in which the lower suture from the nostril was aberrant, and all the species of the genus I know show wonderful constancy in the condition of the nasal shield, the nostril, and the sutures proceeding therefrom. It would be interesting to know if the many specimens in the British Museum referred to T. braminus collected by Colonel Beddome from the Anamallay and Tinnevelly Hills, have the peculiarity now pointed out by me. (Wall 1919)Description: Rostral.-About one-third the breadth of the head, extending back to the level of the eyes. Nasals.-Not meeting behind the rostral; completely divided; the suture below the nostril shorter than that above, and passing to the 2nd labial. Prefrontal, frontal and interparietal--Subequal. Supraocular, pre and postparietals---Subequal. Prae-ocular--About as large as the ocular ; in contact with the 2nd and 3rd labials. Ocular. Large, in contact with the 3rd and 4th labials. Suboculars.---None. Temporal.--One. Labials.---Four. Costals.-In 20 rows. The eye is beneath the suture dividing the ocular and supraocular shields, and is distinct. The nostril is inferior. The tail ends in a small acute spine. The diameter of the body is 1/40 to 1/45 the total length. (Wall 1919)Colour. Dark uniform purplish-brown above paler beneath, where the scales are pale brown except in the basal third which is deep plum coloured. (Wall 1919)Length. Three apparently adult specimens measure respectively 5.875, 5.625 and 5.375 inches. One younger is 4.5 and two others 2.75 inches. (Wall 1919)

Typhlops gonavensis	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	DESCRIPTION: Maximum TL 220 mm; TL/taillength 38-54 in males, 50-88 in females; TL/midbody diameter 46-57; middorsal scale rows 399-455; scale rows 20-20; head tapered, snout rounded to weakly pointed and somewhat flattened; rostral broad in dorsal aspect, clavate to oval, not flared on apex; postoculars 2. Coloration unicoior dark reddish brown grading to burnt-umber on tail; unpigmented areas around mouth and vent (Schwartz & Henderson 1991: 648).
Antillotyphlops granti	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	DESCRIPTION: Maximum TL 210 mm; TL/taillength 43-55; TL/midbody diameter 54-60; middorsal scale rows 370-421; scale rows 18-16; head shape truncate; rostral broad in dorsal aspect, oval to parallel, not flared on apex, no labial flare; postoculars 2. Coloration bicolor, very pale brown dorsal pigmentation on about 7 dorsalmost scale rows, most pigmented scales fading and pigmentation dropping out on next most ventral 1 or 2 rows (Schwartz & Henderson 1991: 649).
Typhlops hectus	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: A moderate sized, 20-scale-row species of Typhlops, having moderate middorsal scale counts  (284–328) and a low frequency of posterior reduction.  Typhlops hectus differs from the other 20-row species  with ~300 middorsal scales in its clavate rostral shape in which the rostral broadens posteriorly, becoming  broadly rounded at the tip (Fig. 3A). The anterior projection of the preocular has a relatively small angle and  sharp apex. The posterior nasal-preocular suture curves gradually ventrad. The suture between the preocular  and the 3rd infralabial is relatively short. The edges of the posterior nasals flanking the rostral tend to bowed  out. The pigmentation is variable but most populations are relatively lightly pigmented, ranging from medium  to pale brown or tan, often with irregularities or mottling and a pale snout. The hemipenes are trumpet-shaped.
Malayotyphlops hypogius	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: “T. hypogia is a member of the ruficauda group which is composed of the Philippine species T. canlaonensis, T. luzonensis, T. rubra, and T. ruficauda. Only one extralimital species, T. kraali of the Kei Islands off the southwest coast of New Guinea, has been definitely referred to the group. The new species differs from T. canlaonensis. T. rubra, and T. ruficauda in having the preocular in contact with the second and third supralabials (in contact with the third supralabial only, in the three above species), and in having 24 scale rows around the mid-body (30 in canlaonensis, 26 in rubra, and 30 in ruficauda). T. hypogia may be distinguished from T. luzonensis by the number of rows of midbody scales (hypogia with 24 versus luzonensis with 20), and the nature of the nasal division (hypogia with incompletely divided nasals versus completely divided nasals in luzonensis). T. kraali differs from the new form principally in having the preocular in contact with only the third supralabial.” (Savage 1950: 52).Detailed DESCRIPTION: see Savage 1950 (OCR imperfect).
Antillotyphlops hypomethes	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis (genus). Species of Antillotyphlops have (1) eye, distinct, (2) snout, rounded (rarely acuminate), (3) head scale arrangement, non-circular, (4) frontorostral, absent, (5) nasal, completely divided, (6) nasal suture origin, supralabial 2, (7) suboculars or subpreoculars, absent, (8) postoculars, 2 (rarely 1; average 2.0), (9) preocular-la- bial contact, supralabial 3, (10) midbody scale rows, 16–24 (average, 20.5), (11) scale row reduction, present, (12) total scale rows, 299–499 (average, 378), (13) caudals, 11–14 (average, 12.3), (14) maximum total length, 110–360 (average, 233) mm, (15) total length/midbody diameter, 37–70 (average, 46.8), (16) total length/tail length, 30–61 (average, 44.5), (17) dorsal color, brown, grayish-brown, or yellow, (18) ventral color, white or cream (rarely brown), (19) dorsum darker than venter, and (20) overall, lacking any distinctive pattern (spots, lines, or stripes), although rarely faint trace of lines (Tables 1–2); molecular phylogenetic support (Figs. 1, 3).Antillotyphlops is distinguished from Cubatyphlops by the presence of 2 postoculars (versus 1) and preoc- ular contact with supralabial 3 only (versus contact with supralabials 2 and 3 in Cubatyphlops). The same distinc- tion holds for Antillotyphlops versus the more distantly related Amerotyphlops, although 4 species of that genus have more than 1 postocular (Thomas 1968; 1976; Dixon & Hendricks 1979; Thomas & Hedges 2007). A closer comparison is needed between Antillotyphlops and Typhlops. With a cladistic analysis of morphological characters, Thomas (1989) found that species placed here in the genus Antillotyphlops (A. dominicana, A. granti, A. monensis, and A. richardi) formed a group based on the sharing of attenuate hemipenes, although he included Typhlops sulcatus in that group and placed A. monastus in a separate group with T. jamaicensis (hemipene data are not avail- able for some species). Also, Antillotyphlops have more total scale rows than Typhlops (378 versus 312; averages) and are thinner-bodied (TL/MBD = 46.8 versus 35.9; averages) [HEDGES et al. 2014: 44].

Coloration bicolor with medium to dark brown dorsal pigmentation, dropping out abruptly along a midlateralline (Schwartz & Henderson 1991: 650).
Indotyphlops jerdoni	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Description: Snout rounded, strongly projecting; nostrils lateral. Rostral narrow, its breadth 1/4 to 2/5 that of the head, extending to the level of the eyes; nasal completely divided, the lower cleft passing to the 2nd labial; ocular and preocular longer than the posterior nasal; eye very distinct, in the ocular; lower edge of ocular shield wedged in between 3rd and 4th labials; supraocular larger than the prefrontal, which is in contact with or just separated from the rostral; tail ending in a spicule; 22 scales round the body, the diameter of which is contained 35-45 times in the total length; 260-280 transverse rows of scales (Smith 1943: 50).Coloration: Dark brown or blackish above, light brown below; snout and anal region whitish (Smith 1943: 50).
Argyrophis klemmeri	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: “A rather thick-bodied species, width contained in length about 28 times; nasal partially divided beyond nostril, nasal suture arising from second labial; width of rostral above, two fifths width of head between eyes; nasals narrowly separated behind rostral; interparietal not or scarcely differentiated; a preocular but no subocular; 23 scalerows around body; about 292 transverse scalerows from rostral to caudal spine; no gland or pit under imbricating portion of nasal.” (Taylor 1962: 253) Description of type: “Rostral reaching back to anterior level of eyes, two fifths as wide above as width of head between eyes; prefrontal small touching rostral and narrowly separating nasals; frontal distinctly wider than prefrontal, a little larger than supraoculars; interparietal not differentiated from body scales; a pair of parietals as wide as frontal but scarcely as large; supraocular suture with ocular above not crossing eye; suture between preocular and ocular crossing eye; nasal suture arising from second supralabial passes slightly beyond nostril, not dividing scale completely; two postoculars between fourth supralabial and parietal; 23 scalerows around body from neck to vent; transverse scalerows 291 or 292 (count on two sides); anal scales not or scarcely differentiated; tail ending in a strong spine directed downward. Width of body in total length about 28 times.” (Taylor 1962: 253)
Malayotyphlops koekkoeki	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Original description: “Snout rounded, slightly angular. Nostril inferior the nasal cleft proceding from the first upper labial, hardly extending beyond the nostril. Rostral very broad, its width contained 1.5 times in the width of the head. Preocular present, broader than the ocular, in contact with the second and third upper labials. Ocular in contact with the third and fourth upper labials. First upper labial long and narrow. Eyes indistinctly visible through the preocular, their posterior border just reaching beyond this shield. Rostral followed by three transversely enlarged shields: prefrontal, frontal and interparietal. Supraoculars and parietals also enlarged. Scales in 26 rows round the middle of the body. Diameter of body contained 40.4 times in the total length ; length of tail contained 62.6 times in the total length; tail broader than long, ending in a spine, its width contained 0.6 times in its length. Total length 445 mm. Colour (in alcohol): greyish-brown above, lighter below. This specimen is rather soft; after the description had been made some of the posterior head-scales fell off, and the figures have, therefore, been restricted to the anterior part of the head only. The lower jaw was damaged too, and could not be drawn. In the Amsterdam Museum the specimen was labelled Typhlops lineatus; probably it was assumed that the preocular was absent, and that the shield through which the eye is visible was the ocular. Comparison with other species shows, however, that the shield which covers the greater part of the eye is the same as the preocular of other species.” (Brongersma 1934: 187).
Malayotyphlops kraalii	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Description: Snout rounded, projecting; nostrils lateral. Rostral about one third the width of the head, not extending to the level of the eyes; nostril between two nasals, the anterior in contact with the first and second labials; praeocular present, as broad as the ocular, in contact with the third labial only; eyes distinct; head-scales feebly enlarged; four upper labials. Body with 24 26 scales round the middle; its diameter 40 to 42 times in the total length; tail as long as broad, ending in a spine (De Rooij 1917).Color: Blackish-brown; lower surface of head and middle of belly yellowish.Total length 265 mm (De Rooij 1917).
Indotyphlops lankaensis	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: Head oval, seen from above; suture, dividing nasal completely, reaches to preocular; 20 scale rows about body; rostral somewhat less than one-third greatest width of head; transverse scale rows about body, 229-261; generally brown to gray-brown above with very dim longitudinal dorsal lines, the median most distinct; under side of head very largely cream color. (Tayler 1947: 287)
Amerotyphlops lehneri	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: A n attenuate and diminutive Typhlops with a depressed snout and invariably 20 scale rows about the body; nasal cleft complete; dorsal scales from rostral to tail spine average 320; color pattern consists of 11 (occasionally 13) olive brown to light brown lines on a yellowish ground color, pattern sharply bicolored laterally, clear yellow below lateral dark line and beneath tail; rostral and tail spine bright yellow. (Dixon & Hendricks 1979: 19).
Indotyphlops leucomelas	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: Differs from jerdoni as follows: Breadth of rostral above that of the head; diameter of the body 32 times in the total length (Smith 1943: 50).Description: “Snout rounded and moderately projecting; nostrils lateral. Rostral narrow, its upper portion about one third the width of the head, extending to between the eyes; nostril between two nasals, the anterior of which is in contact with the first and second labials and extends to the upper surface of the head; a praeocular, nearly as large as the ocular, in contact with the second and third labials; eyes distinct; upper head-scales a little larger than the scales on the body; four upper labials.

Afrotyphlops lineolatus	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Description in BROADLEY & WALLACH 2009.
Indotyphlops longissimus	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: Tail twice the length of the width of the head, cylindrical, straight, rounded at the end and armed with a little thorn. Nasal strips in sub-rectangular, placed lengthwise on each side of the lower part of the rostral. Eyepieces in vertical strips, sub-hexagons, less developed only the preoculars and revealing only very faintly the eyes through. Yellowish head, whole body of a gray tint. (translated from DUMÉRIL & BIBRON 1844)
Typhlops lumbricalis	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis (genus). Species of Typhlops have (1) eye, distinct, (2) snout, rounded, (3) head scale arrangement, non-circular, (4) frontorostral, absent, (5) nasal, completely divided (rarely incomplete), (6) nasal suture origin, supralabial 2, (7) suboculars or subpreoculars, absent (rarely present), (8) postoculars, 2 (rarely 1 or 3; average, 1.85), (9) preocular-labial contact, supralabial 3 (rarely none), (10) midbody scale rows, 18 or 22 (average, 20.0), (11) scale row reduction, present or absent, (12) total scale rows, 231–457 (average, 312), (13) caudals, 8–19 (average, 13.1), (14) maximum total length, 126–445 (average, 243) mm, (15) total length/midbody diameter, 23–57 (average, 35.9), (16) total length/tail length, 18–88 (36.8), (17) dorsal color, always pigmented, brown or tan, (18) ventral color, unpigmented (pinkish), white, or cream, (19) dorsum darker than venter, and (20) overall, lacking any distinctive pattern (spots, lines, or stripes), although rarely a faint trace of a dorsal line (Tables 1–2); molecular phylogenetic support(Figs. 1, 3).Among its closest relatives (Figs. 1, 3), Typhlops is distinguished from Cubatyphlops by the presence of 2 postoculars (versus 1; except in 3 species of Typhlops with 1 postocular) and preocular contact with supralabial 3 only (versus contact with supralabials 2 and 3 in Cubatyphlops) (Table 2). The same distinction holds for Typhlops versus the more distantly related Amerotyphlops, although 4 species of that latter genus have more than 1 postocular (Thomas 1968; 1976; Dixon & Hendricks 1979; Thomas & Hedges 2007). Typhlops and Antillotyphlops require closest comparison. Thomas (1989) found that species placed here in the genus Typhlops formed a group separate from species placed here in Antillotyphlops based on reduction of the basihyal and a lower number of total middorsal scale rows. He excluded T. jamaicensis and T. sulcatus from that definition, but the molecular data place those two species together with others in Typhlops sensu stricto [HEDGES et al. 2014: 47]. For an alternative diagnosis see PYRON & WALLACH 2014: 45.Diagnosis: Typhlops lumbricalis (sensu stricto) is the smallest West Indian blind snake (166 mm maximum TL). This species, three described species from Hispaniola (T. schwartzi, T. tetrathyreus, and T. titanops), and two Cuban species described in this paper are related and define a species group: the T. lumbricalis (see Discussion). This group can be distinguished from other West Indian species groups by its 20 scale rows anteriorly, reducing posteriorly to 18 scale rows, low middorsal scale counts (,350, occasionally ,300), single preocular contacting with third supralabial only, and two postoculars. Typhlops lumbricalis (sensu stricto) differs from some of these species (including new Cuban species) by its rounded snout (in dorsal and lateral views), narrow oval rostral in dorsal view (0.51–0.61 RWD/RLD), weakly divergent post-nasal pattern, small parietals, and low middorsal scale counts (,275). The closest species from Hispaniola is T. tetrathyreus. Both species have a rounded snout, low middorsal scale counts (,285), and narrow oval rostral in dorsal view. But T. lumbricalis (sensu stricto) can be distinguished from T. tetrathyreus by its dorsal snout pattern (rounded vs. weakly ogival) and postnasal pattern (parallel to weakly divergent vs. calyculate). Because the new Cuban species were previously confused with T. lumbricalis, our discussion below will focus mostly on diagnostic traits among them.
Malayotyphlops luzonensis	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis (genus). Species of Malayotyphlops have (1) eye, distinct (rarely indistinct), (2) snout, rounded, (3) head scale arrangement, non-circular, (4) frontorostral, absent, (5) nasal, incompletely divided (sometimes completely divided), (6) nasal suture origin, 2nd supralabial (rarely, 1st supralabial), (7) suboculars or subpreoculars, absent (rarely present), (8) postoculars, 2–4 (average, 2.75), (9) preocular-labial contact, supralabials 2 & 3 or 3rd only (rarely 2nd only), (10) midbody scale rows, 24–30 (average, 26.8), (11) scale row reduction, present, (12) total scale rows, 300–461 (average, 367), (13) caudals, 9–14 (average, 11.9), (14) maximum total length, 122–445 (average, 256) mm, (15) total length/midbody diameter, 31–58 (average, 42.0), (16) total length/tail length, 28–71 (average, 51.8), (17) dorsal color, variable (brown, gray-brown, reddish brown, greenish-black, black), (18) ventral color, variable (cream, yellowish, red, pink, pinkish-yellow), (19) dorsum darker than venter, (20) overall, patternless or with longitudinal lines, series of spots, or collar (Tables 1–2); only one species is included in the molecular phylogeny (Fig. 1).In lacking a protrusible hemipenis and retrocloacal sacs (McDowell 1974), Malayotyphlops is separated from most other blindsnakes occurring in Southeast Asia, Indonesia, Australasia, and the western Pacific: Acutotyphlops, Anilios, Cyclotyphlops, Ramphotyphlops, and Sundatyphlops. From other genera of Asiatyphlopinae, Malayotyphlops differs from Acutotyphlops in lacking a frontorostral and from Cyclotyphlops in having non-circular head scales (versus circular arrangement). It differs from Grypotyphlops in lacking subocular scales. It differs from Cyclotyphlops and Indotyphlops in having more postoculars (2.75 versus 1.0–1.03; averages). It differs from Anilios, Cyclotyphlops, Indotyphlops, Ramphotyphlops, Sundatyphlops, and Xerotyphlops in having higher average midbody scale rows (26.8 versus 19.4–23.5). It differs from Anilios, Grypotyphlops, and Sundatyphlops in having fewer total scale rows (367 versus 466–496, averages) and smaller body size (TL = 256 versus 353–630; averages). See also comments below regarding other potential diagnostic characters [HEDGES et al. 2014: 38]. For an alternative diagnosis see PYRON & WALLACH 2014: 55.
Indotyphlops madgemintonae	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: The new species differs from its apparent closest congener T. porrectus Stoliczka (1871) (characters in parenthesis), in having completely divided nasal scale (undivided); fewer middorsals 336 – 364 (414 – 465), presence of a tail spine (cone); dorsal body color dark brown (yellowish brown), ventrum light brown (yellowish); the subcaudal colorless area extends dorsally to include base of the spine (colorless area confined to subcaudals only), micro-ornamentation of body scales of micropits (microstriations).Diagnosis (shermani). Typhlops madgemintonai shermanai is morphology similar to T. madgemintonai, except that the supranasal suture is 50% complete; naris round; a subnarial pit in the inferior nasal suture; preocular and ocular scales subequal; the row of squamous glands, along slightly curved preocular-nasal suture, are thickened.
Indotyphlops malcolmi	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: A small bicolored snake having 20 longitudinal scale rows. 261-273 transverse scale rows around body; fourth labial twice as large as third, notched behind; a single postocular present; brown above and cream below with a brownish pigmented band crossing throat. Glands on head form a distinct, lighter pattern [from TAYLOR 1947].
Letheobia manni	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: “Agrees with T. p. punctatus (including its Liberian synonyms of liberiensis Hallowell, nigrolineatus Hallowell, and intermedia Jan) in possessing 26 midbody scalerows. It differs from both T. p, punctatus and T. leucostictus in its broad and trilobate snout, lateral nostrils, absence of an ocular, and in its midbody diameter being included in its total length 40 times (instead of 24-36 times in punctatus, 45 in leucostictus). In addition, it differs from leucostictus in possessing 26 (instead of 22) midbody scalerows, a preocular as wide as a nasal, incompletely divided nasal, and — though probably of little significance — completely hidden eyes.” (Loveridge 1941)Description: “Snout prominent, trilobate as seen from above, rounded, without obtuse horizontal edge ; rostral half the width of the head ; nasal swollen, semidivided, the suture extending from the second labial to the nostril, which is lateral ; preocular present, as broad as the nasal, much broader than either of the small scales which might be termed an ocular, the lower in contact with the third labial; eyes hidden; only 3 upper labials. Midbody scalerows 26. Diameter of body included 40 times in total length, tail broader than long, ending in an obtuse spine.” (Loveridge 1941)Coloration: “About to slough. Above, silvery gray, base of each scale with a transverse brown spot. Below, yellowish gray, with a few fine black flecks.” (Loveridge 1941)Measurements: “Total length 343 (338 + 5) mm.; diameter at mid-body 8.5 mm.” (Loveridge 1941)
Ramphotyphlops marxi	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: Typhlops marxi can be distinguished from all other Philippine scolecophidians by unique combination of 30 midbody scale rows, snout having a horizontal transverse edge, and type T-0 supralabial imbrication pattern. In addition, it is unusual in presence of V-shaped transversely enlarged interparietal and multicameral tracheal lung with type B foramina. (Wallach 1993)
Indotyphlops meszoelyi	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: Typhlops meszoelyi can be distinguished from all southern Asian Typhlops except T. exiguus and T. loveridgei by the combination of 18 longitudinal scale rows plus a T-III supralabial imbrication pattern.

Indotyphlops violaceus	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: A small Typhlops with eyes dim, but discernible; the nasal completely divided; the nostril lateral but not visible above, the suture dividing nasal touching the preocular far from the labial; 20 longitudinal scale rows; none or only a very small terminal spine; 245 transverse scale rows on body; body width in total length about 31 times. Color, dull violet to lavender, almost the same above and below [from TAYLOR 1947].
Xerotyphlops wilsoni	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Original description: “Costals: 2 heads lengths from head 24, midbody 24, 2 heads lengths before anus 22. Rostral: About one-third the breadth of the head, not reaching as far back as the eyes, in contact with the internasal. Nasals: Just fail to meet behind rostral. The nostril is lateral; an upper suture passes towards but fails to meet the rostral, the lower suture passes to the 2nd labial. Prœocular: Touches the 2nd and 3rd labials, and the subocular. Ocular: Separated from labial by a subocular. The eyes are distinct, and their diameter about half the ocular shield. Supraoculars: Just fail to meet. The inter-nasal, frontal, and supraocular shields subequal, and smaller than the occipitals, and parietals which are subequal. Labials: Four. Snout rounded. Length 1 foot 1.5 inches, i.e., 38 times the diameter at mid-body. Tail with a single small spine directed downwards, and slightly backwards. Colour: Uniform dirty brown.” (slighly modified after Wall 1908)
Amerotyphlops yonenagae	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: “Typhlopidae pequeno com sutura nasal incompleta. Dezoito escamas ao redor domeio do corpo, sem reducoes; 259 a 269 escamas dorsais. Dorso creme com uma linha mediodorsal escura bern marcada; ventre imaculado.” [from RODRIGUES 1991]

Amerotyphlops stadelmani	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis. “Typhlops stadelmani can be distinguished from all other Honduran snakes, except for the other blindsnakes (Anomalepis mexicanus, Epictia ater, E. magnamaculata, Ramphotyphlops braminus, Typhlops costaricensis, and T. tycherus), by having similarly-sized scales completely around the body and a tiny eye located beneath an ocu lar scale. Anomalepis mexicanus has 22-24 scales around the body and the prefrontal and supranasal scales not fused with each other (versus 20 scales around body and prefrontal and supranasal scales fused in T. stadelmani). The species of Epictia have 14 scales around the body and the infranasals and oculars bordering the lip line (versus 20 scales around body and infranasals and oculars separated from lip line by supralabials in T. stadelmani). Ramphotyphlops braminus has brown to black dorsal and ventral surfaces (versus pink dorsal and ventral surfaces in T. stadelmani). Typhlops costaricensis has dark brown dorsal and ventral surfaces and T. tycherus has 22 scales around the body and a dark brown dorsal surface, (versus pink dorsal and ventral surfaces and 20 scales around body and in T. stadelmani).” (McCranie 2011: 56)Detailed description: McCranie 2011: 56
Amerotyphlops amoipira	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: A small, slightly pigmented Typhlops with incomplete nasal suture, 18 scales around the body (without reduction), and 212-242 dorsals.
Xerotyphlops etheridgei	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: Typhlops etheridgei can be distinguished from all other African Typhlopidae by the following combination of characters: T-III supralabial imbrication pattern (SIP) and 24 midbody scale rows. Typhlops etheridgei is separable from Rhinotyphlops by the T-III SIP (vs. T-0 or T-II), from Acutotyphlops by the 24 midbody scale rows (vs. 26-36) and rounded snout (vs. pointed snout), from Cyclotyphlops by its typical head shields (vs. circular arrangement), and from Xenotyphlops by the T-III SIP (vs. T-0) and papillaless rounded snout (vs. pointed snout with papillae). Typhlops etheridgei shares the T-III SIP with Ramphotyphlops and because it is represented solely by a female specimen, the status of the hemipenis cannot be ascertained. However, it is unlikely that T. etheridgei belongs in the genus Ramphotyphlops as the only African representative is R. braminus, the parthenogenetic species that has colonized the world. Typhlops etheridgei can be distinguished from R. braminus by the infranasal suture contacting the second supralabial (vs. preocular) and 24 midbody scale rows (vs. 20 rows). 
Indotyphlops lazelli	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: Typhlops lazelli can be distinguished from all other typhloids of Asia (except T. porrectus) by the combination of 18 midbody scale rows and  supralabial imbrication patterns (SIP) with both second and thrid supralabials overlapping shields above them. From T. porrectus it is differentiated by a unicameral trachel lung, absence of enlarged occipitals, and a projecting mental shield.
Letheobia pauwelsi	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: Letheobia pauwelsi can be separated from all Letheobia and Rhinotyphlops by 22 scale rows throughout, a T-0 supralabial imbrication pattern, and a unicameral right lung. It can be distinguished from L. caecus by its granular rostral, supranasals not extending beyond rostral, and inferior nasal suture contacting the rostral. It can be separated from L. acutirostratus by its 22 midbody scale rows, an  unenlarged frontal, and contact between the  frontal and supranasals. Letheobia pauwelsi  can also be separated from both L. caecus and  L. acutirostratus by its hourglass rostral and the  corneal cutting edge of the rostral directed ventrally at a 45° angle.Colour in life: Body dark pink, head, tongue and tail tip pale yellow, eye faintly visible. Colour of dorsum in preservative beige, middorsal 10 rows faintly pigmented; venter immaculate cream, unpigmentled.
Typhlops proancylops	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: A large, 20-scale-row species of Typhlops, having no posterior reduction.  This species was  previously included within T. hectus (Thomas, 1974) and the major comparison is with that species (Table 1).  Typhlops proancylops is allopatric with T. hectus and differs from that species in having a narrower rostral that  is widest more anteriorly than in T. hectus and which tapers towards the tip, in contrast to the clavate rostral of  T. hectus that widens towards the tip (Figs. 3, 6A). It has a larger, broader anterior projection of the preocular  that is not smoothly rounded but has two angles near the apex, in contrast to T. hectus, which has, on the average, a more acuminate apex (Fig.3). The posterior nasal-preocular suture has an angled deflection, rather than  a continuously curved suture as in T. hectus.  The suture between the preocular and the 3rd infralabial is relatively long in comparison to T. hectus (Fig. 6B).  The edges of the posterior nasals flanking the rostral tend to  be straight or very slightly divergent, whereas those of T. hectus are more bowed out. Also, T. proancylops is  more heavily pigmented, with pigment in the facial region on the preoculars, posterior nasals, and rostral, in  contrast to the pale-snouted T. hectus (excepting the Morne Salagnac snakes referred to above). The hemipenes of T. proancylops are distinctive in being trumpet-shaped and capitate with a fleshy rim around the apex;  no other West Indian species is known to have this morphology (Thomas, 1976).  Other species of West Indian  Typhops have trumpet-shaped organs that are flat apically (Thomas, 1976); in one species, T. rostellatus Stejneger, the organ is domed or rounded apically, but none have a comparable rim.
Typhlops agoralionis	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: This is a moderate sized 20-scale-row species of Typhlops having no posterior reduction.  Typhlops agoralionis is sympatric with T. hectus and differs from that species in having a narrow, nearly parallel-sided rostral, in contrast to the clavate rostral of T. hectus that widens towards the tip (Fig. 6). The rostral  difference also is reflected in lower, essentially non-overlapping, RW1/RL1 values (0.41–0.45 versus 0.45–  0.64). It also has a large, broadly rounded anterior projection of the preocular and a shorter, more steeply  angled suture between the preocular and the second supralabial; this is in contrast to the preocular of T. hectus  which is V-shaped and pointed (Fig. 6). The rostral wide point of T. agoralionis is smaller and does not overlap with that of T. hectus (0.14–0.32 versus 0.41–0.70).  The edges of the posterior nasals flanking the rostral  are parallel-side or slightly divergent. Typhlops agoralionis is also a shorter-tailed species (TL/TA 27–31,  males) than either T. hectus or T. proancylops (TL/TA 20–24, males). Heavy pigmentation with pigment on  the facial region and on the body extends irregularly across the venter, although the ventral pigmentation is  lighter by virtue of both lessened intensity and dropping out of scales. Typhlops agoralionis is generally more  similar to T. proancylops than to T. hectus but differs from T. proancylops in having a more straight-sided,  somewhat narrower rostral and in the anterior extension of the preocular being rounded rather than with  breaks (Fig. 3); the apical diameter averages larger (Fig. 6D) and the suture length between the preocular and  third labial scale is shorter (Fig. 6E) in T. agoralionis versus T. proancylops.
Typhlops sylleptor	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: This is a moderate sized 20 scale-row species of Typhlops having no posterior reduction.  Typhlops sylleptor is sympatric with T. hectus. It differs from T. hectus in being more blunt-snouted, having  smaller eyes, and having a narrowly oval rostral (Fig. 3D in THOMAS & HEDGES 2007), in contrast to the clavate rostral of T. hectus (Fig.  3A) that widens towards the tip. A large, broadly rounded anterior projection of the preocular also differentiates it from T. hectus, which has preocular with sharply pointed apex (Fig. 3A). These differences can be seen  also in graphs of RW1/RL1 versus HR (Fig. 6F), RWP versus RW1/RL1 (Fig. 6G), and PD versus HR (Fig. 6H). Typhlops sylleptor is also a shorter tailed species (TL/TA 27–43, males) than either T. hectus or T. proancylops (TL/TA 20–24, males). From T. proancylops (Fig. 3B), T. sylleptor also differs in having a preocular  scale without a bent edge, and a relatively larger preocular angle and smaller preocular diameter (Fig. 6I). The  edges of the posterior nasals flanking the rostral are parallel-sided or slightly divergent in T. sylleptor compared with T. proancylops. From T. agoralionis (Fig. 3C), T. sylleptor differs in having differently-shaped rostral and preocular scales, a larger, non-overlapping, rostral wide point (0.39–0.47 versus 0.14–0.32), and a  wider rostral in relation to rostral length, reflected in graphs of RWP versus RW1/RL1 (Fig. 6G) and RL1 versus RW1 (Fig. 6J). Also, pigmentation in T. sylleptor is heavy, with pigment on the facial region extending  irregularly across the venter.
Typhlops eperopeus	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: This is a large, 20-scale-row species of Typhlops, not reducing to 18 scale rows posteriorly or  reducing about 2/3 the way along the body. Despite the fact that specimens of this species were previously  included within T. hectus (Thomas, 1974), T. eperopeus agrees with T. titanops in the presence of reduction  from 20 to 18 scale rows fairly far anteriorly (60–65% of the TL) in some individuals (all T. titanops reduce at  around midbody; T. hectus reduce at 73–94% TL). It differs from T. titanops in having a greater number of  middorsal scales (307–329 versus 231–264). In body size (TL), T. eperopeus averages larger: 140–281 (  =  234) mm versus 145–216 (  = 185) mm in T. titanops.  From the standpoint of size, middorsal counts and head scale shapes, however, the major comparisons are  with T. hectus and the other species described herein. Typhlops eperopeus is sympatric with T. proancylops  and differs from that species in having a nearly parallel-sided rostral (oval in T. proancylops), having a rostral  wide point relatively far posterior (anterior in T. proancylops; Fig. 7A and following figure references in THOMAS & HEDGES 2007) and having a preocular with rounded  apex (two angles near the apex in T. proancylops; Fig. 3B). Typhlops eperopeus differs from T. hectus in having a nearly parallel-sided rostral (distinctly clavate in T. hectus), and having a preocular with rounded apex  (pointed in T. hectus; Figs. 3, 7B). Typhlops eperopeus differs from T. agoralionis in having a broader rostral  (RW1/RL1 0.51–0.58 versus 0.41–0.45 in T. agoralionis), having a straight-edged (V-shaped) preocular  extension (lower edge with angled bend in T. agoralionis; Fig. 3C). Typhlops eperopeus differs from T. sylleptor in having a broader rostral (RW1/RL1 0.51–0.58 versus 0.44–0.50 in T. sylleptor), a nearly parallel-sided  rostral (oval in T. sylleptor), and in having a rostral wide point relatively far posterior (Fig. 7A).
Cubatyphlops perimychus	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: A moderately large species of the Typhlops biminiensis Group differing from T. biminiensis in having a rostral with an acuminate posterior edge, not broadly rounded. Also, the rostral has parallel sides and is not indented at the apex of the snout (Fig. 8 in THOMAS & HEDGES 2007). Typhlops perimychus additionally differs from T. biminiensis in having a more protuberant snout (NE) and a larger preocular apical diameter (PD), as noted above (Figs. 10A–10C).  Diagnostic characters distinguishing this species from the other Cuban species will be discussed below as those species are described.
Cubatyphlops arator	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: A large species of the Typhlops biminiensis Group that has a greater number of middorsal scales than any other West Indian species (578–579). Also, it has 26 scale rows anteriorly, more than any other West Indian species. It also has a uniquely shaped rostral (Fig. 8), which differs from T. biminiensis in having an acuminate posterior edge (as in other Cuban species), not broadly rounded (Fig. 8F). The rostral scale also rounds the tip of the snout without narrowing, which is unique among Cuban species in the group, reflected in a high RW2 (Fig. 10D). Typhlops arator additionally has a large protrusion (umbo) of the snout (Fig. 8F).
Cubatyphlops anousius	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: An apparently small species of Typhlops of the T. biminiensis species group distinguished  from other members of the group by a lack of pigment (except for the eyes). From T. arator it can be distinguished by a relatively smaller and differently shaped rostral (Figs. 8, 10A in THOMAS & HEDGES 2007) and fewer dorsal scales (465–513  versus 578–579). The rostral of T. anousius is narrower dorsally (RW1) and at the labial border (RW3) than  that of its closest relative, T. perimychus (Fig. 10E); RW1/RL1 = 0.74–0.77 versus 0.79–1.05 in T. perimychus. Typhlops anousius is the most extreme all the species in the width of the upper arm of the anterior nasal:  ANTNAS/RW1 = 0.40–0.64 versus 0.34–0.39 in T. perimychus. In its narrow rostral T. anousius is somewhat  similar to T. epactius, although its rostral is narrower (RW1/RL1, 0.74–0.77 versus 0.78–0.85) and straighter  sided.  Additionally, T. anousius differs from T. epactius in its lack of pigment with the latter having normally  pigmented scale rows 9–11 (neck-midbody), its shorter tail (TL/TA 55–56 versus 40–48) and in being somewhat heavier bodied (TL/MBD 45–55 versus 55–58), and in having 24 scale rows (reducing at 2% TL) rather  than 22 (no reduction).
Cubatyphlops notorachius	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: A relatively large species of the Typhlops biminiensis group differing from T. biminiensis in  having a rostral with an acuminate posterior edge, not broadly rounded. Also, the rostral has parallel sides and  is not indented at apex of the snout (Fig. 8). Additionally, T. notorachius has a proportionately smaller rostral  than the preceding species (T. biminiensis, T. arator, T. perimychus, and T. anousius) (Figs. 8, 10A). The difference in body size between T. notorachius and T. perimychus is striking; not considering the associated  specimen of the latter species (which may be a different species), all four specimens of T. notorachius (282–  301 mm TL) are larger than all 18 specimens of T. perimychus (130–280 mm TL). Because each species was  collected at multiple localities and, in the case of T. perimychus, over four decades, we surmise that the body  size difference is real and not the result of collecting bias. Also, T. notorachius differs from T. perimychus in  having a greater anterior nasal width (ANTNAS/RW1): 0.42–0.53 versus 0.34–0.39 in T. perimychus. From T.  anousius, T. notorachius also differs in its point of scale row reduction: 15–40% TL versus 2% TL in T. anousius.
Cubatyphlops contorhinus	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: A moderately large and slender species of the T. biminiensis group differing from all members  of the species group in the Bahamas and Cuba in having a short rostral (Fig. 8), reflected in the high rostral  indent (RI) value (Fig. 10F), and a large preocular apical diameter (Fig. 10C). The short rostral is also  reflected in the width of the upper arm of the anterior nasal, which is relatively larger in T. contorhinus (ANT-NAS/RW1 = 0.49) than other species in the group except T. notorachius and T. anousius. It further differs  from T. biminiensis in having a rostral with an acuminate posterior edge, not broadly rounded, and a more  slender body (TL/MBD 63 versus 39–51). It differs from T. biminiensis, T. arator, and T. perimychus in having a narrower rostral (Fig 10A) that is relatively broad on the apex of the snout (Fig. 8). From T. perimychus,  it also differs in being larger (316 mm versus 280 mm TL), having more middorsal scales (502 versus 453–  496), and a more slender body (TL/MBD 63 versus 41–59).  In body shape, it is more slender (TL/MBD 63)  than T. notorachius, T. anousius, and T. arator (Table 2).  From T. anousius, it also differs in having scale row  reduction at 31% TL rather than 2% TL. From T. arator, it further differs in having 24–22 scale rows rather  than 26–24 rows and in having fewer middorsal scales (502 versus 578–579).
Cubatyphlops anchaurus	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: A slender, moderate sized, and lightly pigmented species of the Typhlops biminiensis group  distinguished from T. biminiensis in having a rostral with an acuminate posterior edge, not broadly rounded,  and a more slender body (TL/MBD 63 versus 39–51).  From T. arator, it differs in having 24–22 scale rows  rather than 26–24 rows, in having fewer middorsal scales (514 versus 578–579), and in being more slender  (TL/MBD 63 versus 51–55 in T. arator). From T. perimychus, it differs in having a greater number of middorsal scales (514 versus 453–496), a well-developed rostral protuberance (umbo), and a more slender body (TL/  MBD 63 versus 41–59). From T. anousius, it differs in having scale row reduction at 31% TL rather than 2%  TL and in having a relatively smaller upper arm of the anterior nasal (ANTNAS/RW1 = 0.36 versus 0.40–0.64  in T. anousius). The latter trait also distinguishes T. anchaurus from T. notorachius (0.42–0.53) and T. contorhinus (0.49).  Additionally, T. anchaurus differs from T. notorachius in having a more slender body (TL/  MBD 63 versus 45–57), and a well-developed umbo.  From T. contorhinus, it also differs in having a relatively larger rostral (Fig. 10A), a smaller preocular apical diameter (Fig. 10C), relatively large eyes, and a  smaller rostral indent (Fig. 10F).
Cubatyphlops satelles	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: A slender and moderately large Typhlops of the T. biminiensis group. It differs from T.  biminiensis in having a smaller rostral (Fig. 10A) with an acuminate posterior edge (Fig. 8K), a relatively  short naris-eye distance (Fig. 10B), a more slender body (TL/MBD 62–75 versus 39–51), and scale row  reduction at 11% TL instead of 50%. It differing from all other Cuban species of the group in having a more  broadly rounded rostral scale in dorsal aspect that narrows less as it proceeds over the apex of the snout (Fig.  8K), and in its low rostral indent (Fig. 10F).  Additionally, it differs from T. perimychus in having a greater  number of middorsal scales (514–527 versus 453–496), scale row reduction at 11% TL instead of 50%, and a  more slender body (TL/MBD 62–75 versus 41–59).  From T. arator it differs in being more slender (TL/MBD  62–75 versus 51–55), having a shorter tail (TL/TA 61 versus 46–48), having scale row reduction at 11% TL  instead of 34–41%, having 22–24 anterior scale rows instead of 26, having 22 posterior scale rows instead of  24, and having fewer middorsal scales (514–527 versus 578–579). From T. anousius it differs in being more  slender (TL/MBD 62–75 versus 45–55), having scale row reduction at 11% TL instead of 2%, having a wider  rostral scale (Fig. 10E), and having a relatively smaller upper arm of the anterior nasal (ANTNAS/RW1 =  0.32–0.33 versus 0.40–0.64). From T. notorachius, it differs in being more slender (TL/MBD 62–75 versus  45–47), having scale row reduction at 11% TL instead of 15–40%, and having a relatively smaller upper arm  of the anterior nasal (ANTNAS/RW1 = 0.32–0.33 versus 0.42–0.53). From T. contorhinus, it differs in having  scale row reduction at 11% TL instead of 31%, having a relatively smaller upper arm of the anterior nasal  (ANTNAS/RW1 = 0.32–0.33 versus 0.49), and lacking a rostral umbo. From T. anchaurus, it differs in having  scale row reduction at 11% TL instead of 31%, and lacking a rostral umbo.
Letheobia jubana	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: Apparently most closely related to Letheobia decorosa of Cameroon, but differing in its rostral, which tapers posteriorly to a blunt point and has an obtusely angular keratinized cutting edge (rostral rounded posteriorly and snout rounded in L. decorosa); its frontal being smaller than a supraocular (larger in L. decorosa); and its lower middorsal count, 391–435 vs 460–542 in L. decorosa.
Letheobia pembana	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: A member of the Letheobia pallida complex, but distinguished by its more numerous scale rows (26-24-24 vs 24-22-22) and lower number of middorsals (353 vs 376-487).
Letheobia swahilica	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: Closely related to Letheobia pallida, distinguished by its more robust build (length/diameter ratio 49–62 vs 62–82) and fewer middorsals (76–92 vs 418–4).
Letheobia toritensis	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: A member of the Letheobia pallida complex, but differing in its greater length (maximum length 270 mm vs 192 mm in L. pallida) and more slender build (length/diameter ratio 62–82 vs 49–62 in L. pallida and L. swahilica); blunt snout, with a broader, subrectangular rostral; frontal transversely enlarged; more numerous middorsals (427–487 vs 76–4) and vertebrae (280–0 vs 25–274). There are also differences in visceral arrangement.
Letheobia largeni	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: Closely related to Letheobia toritensis, but with the supraocular separated from the rostral by nasal/frontal contact and the nasal suture arising from the second supralabial.
Acutotyphlops banaorum	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: Acutotyphlops banaorum can be distinguished from all Typhlopidae except Papua/Solomon Acutotyphlops by any of the following characters: (1) V-shaped lower jaw; (2) short, narrow rostral; (3) an enlarged frontorostral shield; (4) occipital condyle formed solely from the basioccipital; and (5) acuminate contact of four braincase bones (parietal and basisphenoid, frontal and prootic) forming an X-shaped pattern. From the Papua/ Solomon Acutotyphlops it can be separated by the presence of (1) a single ocular and preocular shield (vs. fragmentation into 6–10 shields), (2) three infralabials (vs. 5–7 shields), (3) fourth supralabial as tall as long (vs. at least twice as long as tall), (4) uniformly light dorsum and venter with irregular dark dorsal spots (vs. dark dorsum and light venter separated by a sharp demarcation), and absence of (5) retrocloacal sacs, and (6) a solid, awned hemipenis with helical coils in tail when retracted.
Anilios ammodytes	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: A small, pale, moderately slender blind-snake with rounded snout, 20 mid-body scale rows and nasal cleft proceeding from preocular and usually dividing nasal scale. Differing from R. d. diuersus mainly by narrower rostral (usually less than 0.4 times as wide as head, v. usually more than 0.4) and nasal cleft extending higher on to top of head (from Storr 1981).
Amerotyphlops tycherus	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: Typhlops tycherus can be most readily distinguished from all other snakes in the mainland of the Western Hemisphere based on the number of scale rows around the body (22); all other Typhlops found in the mainland of the Western Hemisphere have 18–18–18 (T. amoipira, T. microstomus, T. paucisquamis, T. stadelmani, T. tenuis and T. yonenagae), 20–20–20 (T. brongersmianus, T. costaricensis, T. lehneri, T. reticulatus, and T. trinitatus), or 20–18–16 or 18–16–14 (T. minuisquamis). Of the Mesoamerican Typhlops, T. tycherus is further differentiated as follows: from T. costaricensis by having a well-defined pale yellowish gray to immaculate white venter (venter somewhat lighter but grading into dorsal coloration throughout most of the body with yellowish gray or unpigmented scales restricted to chin and throat and posterior portion of body, with scattered pale spots along the midventral line in T. costaricensis); from T. microstomus by having fewer dorsal scales between the rostral and tail tip (395, versus 487–566 in T. microstomus), a relatively longer tail (TL/TTL = 1.51, versus 0.37–1.36 in T. microstomus) and by lacking a subocular; from T. stadelmani in having more dorsal scales between the rostral and tail tip (395, versus 341–369 in T. stadelmani) and larger maximum total length (371 mm, versus 310 mm in T. stadelmani); and from T. tenuis in lacking spots on median dorsal scale rows (dorsal spots present on at least median scale rows in T. tenuis) and having larger maximum total length (371 mm, versus 326 mm in T. tenuis). Additional comparative data, measurements, and ratios for the Mesoamerican Typhlops are given in Table 1. From the South American species (other than T. lehneri, which has 18–18–18 scales around the body), T. tycherus is further distinguished by having a completely divided nasal with the suture contacting the rostral (nasal not completely divided in T. amoipira, T. brongersmianus, T. reticulatus, T. trinitatus, T. paucisquamis, and T. yonenagae). In the Western Hemisphere outside of Mesoamerica and South America, T. tycherus most closely resembles the 11 members of the T. biminiensis species group from the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, and Cuba, from which it may be distinguished as follows: having 22–22–22 scales around the body (26–24–24 in T. arator and 20–20–20 in T. caymanensis) and 395 scales between rostral and tail tip (453–579 in T. anchaurus, T. anousius, T. biminiensis, T. contorhinus, T. epactius, T. notorachius, T. paradoxus, T. perimychus, and T. satelles).Typhlops tycherus is distinguished from R. braminus by having 22–22–22 scales around the body (20–20–20 in R. braminus), more dorsal scales between rostral and tail tip (395, versus 290–338 in New World R. braminus), and larger maximum total length (371 mm, versus 173 mm in New World R. braminus).
Cubatyphlops golyathi	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: A large species (360 mm maximum SVL) with moderate body size (57.8 TL/MBD) of the T. biminiensis species group that presents more middorsal scales (> 625) than any other West Indian species (Table 1 in DOMINGUEZ & MORENO 2009). It also presents a posterior reduction of four longitudinal scale rows, this characteristic is unique among species of the group. The closest species is T. arator. Both species are large Cuban blind snakes, have the same number of scale rows at the anterior part of the body (26) and a greater number of middorsal scales than any other West Indian species (Table 1). Also, both species are distributed to the west of the remaining species of the T. biminiensis species group (Fig. 2). However, the new species can be distinguished from T. arator by its posterior scale row reduction (4 rows vs. 2 rows), total middorsals (> 625 vs. < 580), relative tail length (3% vs. 2%), snout and rostral patterns, ocular size (OLM/OW 0.8 vs. 0.5) and sinuosity (0.8 vs. 0.2) [from DOMINGUEZ & MORENO 2009].
Afrotyphlops mucruso	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis (genus): An endemic African genus characterized by the following combination of characters: snout sharply angular in profile, with a keratinized horizontal edge in adults, supralabial imbrication pattern T-II or T-X, nasal shield incompletely divided and lacking posterior concavity, nostrils directed ventrally, inferior nasal suture contacting first or second supralabial or rostral (Megatyphlops anomalus), 3–7 postoculars, dorsal rostral broad (greater than 1/2 interocular head width), ventral rostral broad (greater than 1/2 internarial snout width), well-developed eye with discernible pupil, dorsum pigmented (often with lineate, mottled or blotched pattern), and vestigial left lung present. Other typical characters include 30–44 midbody scale rows, robust body (length/width 17–58), and large size (maximum length 350–950 mm).

Afrotyphlops kaimosae	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Description in BROADLEY & WALLACH 2009.Original Diagnosis: “Differs from T. p. punctatus and all other East African members of the genus Typhlops in possessing an ocular which is broadly in contact with the nasal shield below the preocular, thus separating the latter shield from the upper labials; no subocular as is present in T. p. gierrai.Differs from T. praeocularis Stejneger of Leopoldville, Belgian Congo in the possession of 28 (instead of 24-26) midbody scale-rows; diameter of body being included in total length 43 (instead of 67) times; rounded snout (instead of with sharp cutting edge); habit; coloration.” (Loveridge 1935)Original Description. “Snout prominent, rounded, without obtuse horizontal keel; nostrils inferior; rostral large, more than half the width of head, extending almost to the level of the eyes, which are distinguishable; nasal semidivided, the suture extending from the first labial to the nostril; preocular present, narrower than the nasal, not more than half as broad as the ocular which is in contact with the nasal below the preocular so as to broadly separate the preocular from the labials; ocular in contact with the third and fourth labials; four upper labials. Diameter of body 43 times in the total length; tail broader than long, ending in a spine. Midbody scale-rows 28.” (Loveridge 1935)Coloration. Above, uniformly black. Below, scarcely lighter than above except around the mouth and anus. (Loveridge 1935)Measurements. Total length 215 mm.; head and body 211 mm.; tail 4 mm.; diameter at midbody 5 mm.

Afrotyphlops brevis	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Description in BROADLEY & WALLACH 2009.
Afrotyphlops nanus	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: Superficially resembling Afrotyphlops angolensis, this small species differs externally in its oval rostral with pointed apex (round or sagittate with rounded or truncated apex in A. angolensis), low number of middorsals (287–291 vs 350–535 in East African A. angolensis) and light venter.
Madatyphlops andasibensis	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: Typhlops andasibensis sp. nov. can be distinguished from all other Typhlops by the combination of 26 midbody scale rows, 373–381 total middorsal scales, a slightly trilobed snout in dorsal profile, a rounded snout in lateral profile, a T–V supralabial imbrication pattern, transversely enlarged frontal, postfrontal and interparietal scales, inferior nasal suture contacting second supralabial, and an incomplete superior nasal suture. Within Madagascar, T. andasibensis sp. nov. can be separated from all other typhlopids by the combination of 26 midbody scale rows, less than 400 middorsals, and a T–V supralabial imbrication pattern.
Madatyphlops rajeryi	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: Typhlops rajeryi sp. nov. differs from all other typhlopids by the combination of a T-V imbrication pattern of supralabial scales, 24 mid-body scale rows, between 400 and 420 paravertebral scales, 12 subcaudals, a solidly-built body with a total length/mid-body diameter ratio being less than 37, a rounded snout in dorsal and lateral view, an inferior nasal suture contacting second supralabial, an incomplete superior nasal suture, visible eyes and pupils, and a uniform pink coloration. Among Malagasy typhlopids, a T-V imbrication pattern of supralabial scales distinguishes Typhlops rajeryi from Xenotyphlops grandidieri (Mocquard, 1905) (T-0), Ramphotyphlops braminus (T-III), T. decorsei Mocquard, 1901 (TIII), T. ocularis (T-III) and the Comorian species T. comorensis Boulenger, 1889 (T-III). Compared to T. rajeryi, T. microcephalus (Werner, 1909) has fewer mid-dorsal scales (77–235 versus 412), a low number of scale rows (anterior: 20; mid-body: 20; posterior: 19–20 versus 22; 24; 22, respectively) and the pupil is not visible (distinct in T. rajeryi). Typhlops domerguei Roux-Estève, 1980 has fewer mid-dorsal scales (252–262), fewer subcaudals (6–7 versus 12) and has a short body (SVL: 150–176 versus 265). Typhlops reuteri Boettger, 1881 has also fewer mid-dorsal scales (345– 359) and subcaudals (8–9), has a short (198–222) and thin body (mid-body width: 4.5–5.0 versus 7.4). The type of T. madagascariensis Boettger, 1877 is longer (SVL: 410), has more mid-dorsal scales (580) and has a striped pattern (uniform in T. rajeryi). Typhlops arenarius (Grandidier, 1872) is shorter (SVL: 80–211), thinner (mid-body width: 4.5– 5.0) and has an ogival head shape in dorsal view and wedge shape in lateral view (rounded head shape in dorsal and lateral views in T. rajeryi). Typhlops mucronatus Boettger, 1880 has more scale rows (25–28; 24–28; 24–26), more middorsal scales (488–577), a truncated dorsal head shape and a brown coloration (pink coloration in living specimen, yellow to beige in alcohol for T. rajeryi).
Ramphotyphlops mollyozakiae	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: Since molecular data are lacking for most members of both Ramphotyphlops and Indotyphlops, morphological data must be relied upon for clues to relationships. Ramphotyphlops mollyozakiae is most similar to R. albiceps (currently placed in Indotyphlops by HEDGES et al., 2014), with which it is sympatric, and can be distinguished from R. albiceps by head colour (brown vs. yellow head and nape), number of postoculars (1 vs. 2–4), and the number of helical coils in the hemipenis (0.5 vs. 3.5), in addition to the visceral characters listed in Table 2. Although not diagnostic, due to overlap in ranges, it also has a smaller average number of middorsals (x = 307 vs. 343) and a thicker body proportion (L/W ratio: x = 40 vs. 68). Ramphotyphlops mollyozakiae differs from R. lineatus in fewer scale rows (20 vs. 22–24), relatively longer tail (T/LOA ≥ 1.8% vs. ≤ 1.8%), INS contact (SL 2 vs. SL 1), and number of postoculars (1 vs. 2– 4) and from all other Ramphotyphlops with 20 scale rows, R. mollyozakiae can be distinguished by its SNS being visible on the dorsum of the snout. Ramphotyphlops mollyozakiae can be distinguished from Virgotyphlops braminus by the INS contact (SL 2 vs. pre-ocular) and bisexual mode of reproduction (vs. unisexual) (WALLACH, 2020).From all Asian species of Indotyphlops with 20 scale rows, R. mollyozakiae can be separated from I. jerdoni by a single postocular (vs. 2); from I. lankaensis by total middorsals (> 290 vs. < 265), larger body size (LOA > 150 mm vs. < 130 mm), thinner body proportions (L/W > 38 vs. < 35), and the INS contact (SL 2 vs. pre-ocular); from I. malcolmi by larger body size (> 150 mm vs. < 135 mm), thinner body (L/W > 38 vs. < 32), and nasal shield (divided vs. undivided); from I. pammeces by total middorsals (< 327 vs. > 328), thicker body (L/W < 53 vs. > 54), and nasal shield (divided vs. undivided); from I. porrectus by SIP (T-III vs. T-V), posterior scale rows (20 vs. 18), and total middorsals (< 330 vs. > 400); from I. schmutzi by SIP (T-III vs. T-V), total middorsals (< 330 vs. > 385), and larger body size (> 150 mm vs. < 145 mm); from I. tenebrarum by larger size (≥ 154 mm vs. ≤ 144 mm), broader rostral (RW/HW > 0.35 vs. < 0.30), and nasal shield (divided vs. undivided); from I. veddae by larger body size (> 150 mm vs. < 95 mm), subcaudals (≤ 12 vs. ≥ 13), thicker body (L/W < 55 vs. > 60), and nasal shield (divided vs. undivided); and from I. violaceus by larger body size (≥ 154 mm vs. ≤ 135 mm), and the INS contact (SL 2 vs. pre-ocular) (Table 3 in Wallach 2020).
Typhlops oxyrhinus	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: A species of medium size (257 mm maximum TL) of the Typhlops lumbricalis species group, can be distinguished by the combination of its snout pattern (ogival and pointed in dorsal and lateral views, respectively) and having more middorsal scales (.265, 282 mean) than any other Cuban species of the group and T. lumbricalis (Table 1 in DOMINGUEZ & DIAZ 2011). Typhlops oxyrhinus also differs from other species in this group by its narrow oval rostral in dorsal view (0.52–0.60 RWD/RLD), postnasal pattern (strongly divergent), robust tail (1.7–3.2 TA/TD), parietal pattern, and head size.
Typhlops pachyrhinus	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: A species of medium size (219 mm maximum TL) belonging to the T. lumbricalis species group, with broader rostral (0.75–0.93 RWD/RLD) than any other Cuban species of the group and T. lumbricalis (Table 1). It can also be distinguished from others in the group by its low middorsal scale counts (265–297), rounded snout in dorsal and lateral views, parietals extending toward the head midline, postnasal pattern (strongly divergent), and head size (HWN/HL and HWN/HWM).
Ramphotyphlops adocetus	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: Ramphotyhlops adocetus can be distinguished from other Indoaustralian and Philippine typhlopids by the combination of 22 scale rows over the length of the body; the wedge-shaped snout, without a keratinized keel; and its broad, pyriform rostral.
Ramphotyphlops hatmaliyeb	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: Ramphotyhlops hatmaliyeb can be distinguished from other Indoaustralian and Philippine typhlopids by the combination of 22 scale rows over the length of the body; the wedge-shaped snout, without a keratinized keel; and its broad, ovate rostral.
Typhlops leptolepis	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: The small size (< 215 mm TL), a single preocular in contact with third supralabial only, 20 anterior scale rows reducing posteriorly to 18 scale rows, and < 310 middorsal scale counts associates Typhlops leptolepis with species in the Typhlops lumbricalis species group: T. lumbricalis (Bahamas Islands); T. oxyrhinus and T. pachyrhinus (Cuba); T. schwartzi, T. tetrathyreus, and T. titanops (Hispaniola).The new species can be distinguished from other species in the group by its narrow oval rostral (0.45–0.60 RWD/RLD) in dorsal view with parallel to curved sides, a strong tapering toward anterior tip (Fig. 1), and a distinctive dark umber coloration. It also differs in having a venter color undifferentiated from dorsum, head and neck coloration differentiated from body in ventral view, and a white spot ventrally covering the tail and cloacal opening (Fig. 2).Typhlops leptolepis also differs from those species by a combination of characters (Table 1), e.g. body size, thin body, snout pattern, number and size of the parietals and occipitals, number of postoculars, divergent postnasal pattern, moderate to high middorsal scale counts (> 250, 278 mean), and reduction of the anterior scale rows at midbody or posterior to midbody (67% TL maximum, 57% mean).
Antillotyphlops naugus	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	DIAGNOSIS: A (former) subspecies of Typhlops richardi characterized by far anterior reduction of scale rows, relatively high labial fIare, large size, and a relatively high number (mode 11) of pigmented scale rows [from THOMAS 1966: 190].
Sundatyphlops polygrammicus	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis (genus): Sundatyphlops can be unambiguously diagnosed from Anilios by a combination of just two characters: midbody and middorsal scale rows. For example, of the ten species of Anilios having the same number of midbody scale rows (22) as Sundatyphlops, none has middorsal scale row counts that overlap with those of Sundatyphlops (453–496), as shown in Table 2 of Pyron & Wallach (2014). Thus, Sundatyphlops is morphologically diagnosable, phylogenetically distinct and should be considered as a valid genus [NAGY et al. 2015].Diagnosis: Species of Sundatyphlops have (1) eye, distinct, (2) snout, rounded, (3) head scale arrangement, non-circular, (4) frontorostral, absent, (5) nasal, incompletely or completely divided, (6) nasal suture origin, supralabial 1, 2, or 1/2 suture, (7) suboculars or subpreoculars, unreported, (8) postoculars, unreported, (9) preoc- ular-labial contact, supralabials 2–3, (10) midbody scale rows, 22, (11) scale row reduction, unreported, (12) total scale rows, 496, (13) caudals, 16, (14) maximum total length, 395 mm, (15) total length/midbody diameter, 33–58 (average, 45.5), (16) total length/tail length, 15–52 (average, 33.3), (17) dorsal color, usually dark brown, olive, olive gray, or pale yellow, (18) ventral color, whitish, whitish-pink, or pale yellow, (19) dorsum darker than (rarely similar to) venter, (20) pattern of longitudinal dark lines on yellow ground color, sometimes with same lineate pattern (but paler) on venter (Tables 1–2); only one species is included in the molecular phylogeny (Fig. 1).As noted in the previous account, Sundatyphlops shares with Acutotyphlops, Anilios, and Ramphotyphlops a solid, awn-like protrusible hemipenis and retrocloacal sacs (Robb 1966; McDowell 1974), although not all species have been examined for those traits. From Acutotyphlops, Sundatyphlops can be distinguished by lacking a fron- torostral scale. From Anilios, it can be distinguished by its larger maximum size (mean among species, 395 versus 353 mm TL), higher mean number of midbody scales (22 versus 20.1), and longer tails (TL/TA = 33.3 versus 49.7; averages). From Ramphotyphlops, it can be distinguished by its higher total scale rows (496 versus 419; averages) and larger maximum size (395 versus 302 mm TL; only R. angusticeps, 455 mm TL, has a greater maximum size) [HEDGES et al. 2014: 40].
Afrotyphlops liberiensis	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	“According to Roux-Estève (1974), there are no clear morphological criteria for distinguishing the forest (sub)species A. liberiensis from the savanna (sub)species A. punctatus, except a lower number of mid-dorsal scales for A. liberiensis (26–32) compared to A. punctatus (30–34), the arrangement of subocular/preocular, and a longer maximum and average length for A. liberiensis as compared to A. punctatus. Our 19 specimens from rainforest areas of Guinea have 26 (4 specimens), 28 (11) or 30 (3) mid-dorsal scales, compared to 30 (24) or 32 (4) mid-dorsal scales for the 28 specimens from savanna areas of Guinea that we attribute to A. punctatus. The maximum length was 950 mm for a A. liberiensis female from Konipara (IRD 2669.G, a record size for the species), compared to 592 mm for a A. punctatus female from Kalékouré. Our preliminary molecular data also support the recognition of A. liberiensis as a distinct species. Both marbled and lineated patterns were represented.” (from TRAPE & BALDÉ 2014)
Typhlops silus	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis. A small snake of the genus Typhlops having: 1) 20 longitudinal rows of scales on anterior third of body, 18 to 20 at midbody, and 18 on posterior third of body; 2) 254 to 261 dorsal scales; 3) truncated, slightly trilobate snout; 4) complete or incomplete internasal suture; 5) generally pale dorsal coloration with few or no contrasting darker markings. (Legler 1959: 105)Description of species. Total length 85 to 126 mm.; length of tail one and one half to two mm.; diameter greatest at midbody, two and one half to four mm.; greatest diameter of body contained 30 to 34 times in total length; dorsal scales (from rostral to terminal spine) 254 to 261; spine on tip of tail conical; 20 longitudinal rows of scales on anterior third of body, 18 to 20 at midbody, and 18 on posterior third of body; four infralabials; four supralabials, first smallest, third and fourth largest and subequal; first supralabials flanking a smaller azygous scale immediately below rostral; rostral extending from azygous supralabial to point on top of head between eyes or between anterior borders of oculars; rostral narrowed where it passes over front of snout, part visible in ventral view slightly narrower than part visible in dorsal view; rear edge of rostral rounded, slightly tapered; eye easily discernible beneath translucent ocular scale; diameter of eye approximlately one half greatest width of ocular; a large preocular on each side, its lower border in contact only with third supralabial; ocular bordered above by supraocular anteriorly and by a large parietal posteriorly; supraocular slightly smaller than unmodified dorsals; parietal one and one half to two times size of unmodified dorsals; posterior edge of ocular bordered by two unmodified body scales; lower edge of ocular in contact with third and fourth supralabials; nasals essentially separated into anterior and posterior parts, but upper part of internasal suture complete or incomplete; posterior nasal larger and extending onto top of snout between preocular and rostral, in contact with supraocular; posterior ends of posterior nasals narrowly separated by first dorsal scale, not enclosing rostral; when internasal suture is complete or nearly complete (as in holotype) anterior nasal projects over posterior nasal forming sharp ridge from lower anterior border of nostril to point where suture meets rostral; aforementioned ridge appears as lateral extension of snout in dorsal and ventral views; anterior nasal in contact with second and third supralabials; snout broad and truncated (not evenly rounded or tapered); nasorostral sutures in form of sulci, giving snout inflated, slightly trilobate appearance in dorsal and ventral views; anteriormost parts of anterior nasals extending as far or farther forward than anteriormost part of rostral (paratypes).Color of dorsum pale buffy brown to brownish gray; each dorsal scale having center slightly darker than edges, the contrast being greatest on anterior third of body but nowhere sharp; upper anterior part of snout cream; dim buffy markings (same color as dorsum) on posterior nasals, preoculars, and rostral; eye visible as dark spot; venter uniformly cream. Color of dorsum blending gradually with paler venter approximately midway up side of body; color of tail same as body. (Legler 1959: 105)
Letheobia angeli	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Original description: “Museau arrondi, prominent en vue latérale, très obtus et à peine trilobé en vue dorsale. Rostrale nettement plus large que la moitié de la tête. Nasale grande, en contact avec les labiales supérieures 1 et 2, incomplètement divisée par le sillon nasal issu de la labiale 2. Narine. large, latérale. Préoculaire un peu plus étroite que la nasale, en contact avec les labiales supérieures 2 et 3. En arrière de la préoculaire 2. écailles superposées, l'inférieure en contact avec les labiales 3 et 4 occupe les 2/3 de la hauteur de la préoculaire et put être considérée comme une oculaire; au-dessus de celle-ci une écaille un peu plus petite correspond à une sus-oculaire. Aucune trace d'œil.Écailles de la moitié antérieure du corps : 24, de la moitié postérieure: 22. Diamètre du corps contenu 75 fois dans la longueur.

Le dessous plus pâle.Longueur du corps: 365 (360 + 5) mm., diamètre au milieu: 5 mm.Par son nombre d'écailles T. Angeli se rapproche de T. p. punctatus Leach mais en diffère par les caractères de son écaillure céphalique, 'absence d'cil et son rapport longueur/diamètre du corps. Il diffère également des espèces aveugles signalées de l'ouest africain : de T. caecus Duméril à museau anguleux de profil ; de T. Crossi Blgr., T. caecatus Jan et T. Halloweli Jan soit par la forme du museau soit par les caractères de l'écaillure. L'absence de grande plaque oculaire pourrait le rapprocher de T. Manni Loveridge signalé du Libéria, mais ce dernier a 3 labiales supérieures au lieu de 4), 26 rangs d'écailles (au lieu de 24) et un rapport longueur/diamètre du corps de 40 (au lieu de 75). Pour ces raisons je considère Typhlops Angeli comme nouveau.” (Guibé 1952: 79)
Ramphotyphlops bipartitus	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Original diagnosis: Tail almost twice as long as the width of the head, conical, slightly curved at its point, which is armed with a small thorn. rounded muzzle; rostral large, barely visible from the side view, much more wide at the upper side of the head than at the anterior. Large nasal passages, separated from each other on the top of the head by a broad scale, divided to the level of the nostril, which is directed a little downwards and not visible in the top view of the head. Four supralabials of the same size; small interlabial plate. Preocular plate of the same width as the ocular plate. Scales 22 in number. Upper part of the body yellowish-green, lower part brown clear. [...] on the small specimen, the eyes are very distinct, while they are not visible on the other. The two specimens are, moreover, as similar in all other respects. (Google translation modified after the original in SAUVAGE 1879)Size: Total length, 0.250 and 0.175; head, 0.005 and 0.004; tail, 0.003 and 0.006.
Amerotyphlops arenensis	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: Amerotyphlops arenensis is distinguished from all other South American species by the following combination of characters: nasal suture incomplete; rostral scale oval; supralabial scales four; infralabial scales three; rows scales around the body 18/18/18; middorsal scales 204 to 225; rows of dorsal scales dark brown 12–13th; rows of ventral scales yellowish cream and immaculate 4–5; caudal spine dark brown; subcaudal scales 8–10 in female and 11–13 for males; and maximum TTL 233 mm.The new species differs from Amerotyphlops lehneri by having an incomplete nasal suture (vs. complete nasal suture); from A. brongersmianus, A. reticulatus, and A. minuisquamus by having 18/18/18 rows scales around the body (vs. 18/16/14, 18/18/14, 20/18/14 or 20/18/15 in A. minuisquamus; 20/20/18 or 20/20/20 in A. brongersmianus and A. reticulatus); from A. yonenagae by having less than 250 middorsal scales (vs. more than 250 middorsal); from A. amoipira by having highly pigmented cephalic scales with a dark brown dorsum (vs. few pigmented cephalic scales, creamish brown dorsum with a fine darker brown paravertebral line concentrated in the anterior part of the body) and from A. paucisquamus by having a largest number of middorsal, between 204–225 (vs. fewer number of middorsal, between 162–209).
Anilios insperatus	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: Anilios insperatus sp. nov. is a small, slender blind snake characterized by the following combined characters: 16 midbody scale rows, 442 paravertebral scales, snout slightly trilobed from above and bluntly angular in profile, nasal scale not completely divided, nasal cleft not visible from above and joining the second supralabial scale, small, inconspicuous eyes, located within the ocular scale at its junction with the preocular and the supraocular scales, light uniform colouration with no differentiation between dorsal and ventral surfaces.Comparisons: Only four Australian species of Anilios have 16 scales at midbody, but all are geographically distant. No other species occurring in Queensland has 16 midbody scales and lacks pigmentation, but there are some that are likely to be sympatric with A. insperatus, namely A. affinis, ligatus, nigrescens, proximus, wiedii. All these species, except A. affinis, differ in having the nasal cleft visible from above. For more details see Venchi et al. 2015.
Anilios fossor	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: Anilios fossor is distinguished from all other described species in the genus (sensu Pyron & Wallach 2014) by the combination of 20 midbody scale rows, a rounded snout in lateral profile (lacking any rostroventral angulation), a nasal cleft contacting the second supralabial ventrally, but not extending to the dorsal surface of the head, and a large, round rostral scale. For more detailed comparisons with other species, see Shea 2015.
Malayotyphlops denrorum	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: External characters indicate the new species to be a member of the genus Malayotyphlops as restricted above. Malayotyphlops denrorum can be distinguished from M. ruficaudus and M. canlaonensis by its lower number of longitudinal scale rows (usually 30 in M. ruficaudus and M. canlaonensis behind the head, 26 in M. denrorum), its lighter, more diffusely-edged dorsal stripe, and more extensive pigmentation on the tail. The extreme reduction in size of its third and fourth supralabials, and relatively large eyes, distinguish Malayotyphlops denrorum from species in the T. ruficaudus Group that have 28 or 26 anterior scale rows posterior to the head (M. castanotus, M. collaris, M. hypogius, M. luzonensis, and M. ruber). A key for distinguishing Philippine species of the genus Malayotyphlops is presented in Appendix 2 in WYNN et al. 2016.
Malayotyphlops andyi	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis and Comparison with Other Species.—External charac- ters indicate that Malayotyphlops andyi is a member of the genus Malayotyphlops as restricted above. Malayotyphlops andyi is superficially similar to M. luzonensis, having a similar size and coloration, but it can be distinguished from M. luzonensis by contact between the postnasal and third supralabial in M. andyi, and a more strongly tapered rostral in M. andyi than in M. luzonensis (best visualized in specimens of M. luzonensis by the bordering gland rows, which are roughly parallel under the lateral free edges of the rostral for most of its anterior-to-posterior length, contrasted to underlying gland rows in M. andyi that converge along the anterior-to-posterior length of the rostral). The dorsal stripe also appears to be wider in M. luzonensis, all specimens having a dorsal stripe that is 15 rows wide anteriorly, with only scattered, unpigmented scales in the seventh row (and scattered, pigmented scales in the eighth row in KU 328595), but a stripe that is only 13 rows wide (with only a few scattered, pigmented rows in the seventh row) in the holotype of M. andyi.Like M. luzonensis, in M. ruber the gland rows underlying the lateral edges of the rostral are roughly parallel (compared to convergent in M. andyi), the dorsal stripe is wider in M. ruber (15 rows wide anteriorly in M. ruber, 13 rows wide in M. andyi), and the coloration on the dorsal tail in M. andyi is more irregular. Malayotyphlops andyi can be distinguished from M. collaris by the lower number of middorsal scales (392 in M. andyi vs. 412–461 in M. collaris) and the absence of an unpigmented ‘‘collar’’ behind the head in M. andyi. Malayotyphlops castanotus has fewer middorsals (300–345), and a dorsal stripe that is narrower (nine or 11 rows in width, without an anterior–posterior width reduction), darker, and more sharply demarcated, whereas the dorsal stripe in M. andyi is 13 rows in width anteriorly reducing to 11 slightly before the vent, and the stripe has a more poorly defined lateral edge because of pigmentation reduction in the lateralmost two rows. Malayotyphlops hypogius has 26 scale rows around the anterior body (vs. 28 in M. andyi), 327 middorsals (vs. 392), at least 17 rows in the dorsal stripe along the length of the body (vs. 13 behind the head in M. andyi), and overlap of the second supralabial by the preocular.Malayotyphlops andyi can be distinguished from M. ruficaudus and M. canlaonensis by its lower number of longitudinal scale rows posterior to the head (typically 30 in M. ruficaudus and M. canlaonensis, 28 in M. andyi), its more diffusely edged dorsal stripe due to reduced pigmentation in the two lateralmost longitudinal scale rows, and more extensive pigmentation on the tail in M. andyi. A key for distinguishing Philippine species of the genus Malayotyphlops is presented in Appendix 2 in WYNN et al. 2016.
Letheobia mbeerensis	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: The new species is assignable to the genus Letheobia on the basis of possessing the combination of characters:laterally rounded snout, gracile or worm-like body form, eyes not or barely visible, reduced to faint spots, and pinkish coloration (Pyron & Wallach 2014). Within Letheobia, L. mbeerensis may be distinguished by the following features: rostral broad, ocular shield reduced, 20 scale rows around the body along its entire length, 670 middorsal scales, tail long (for genus) 2.9% of total length, 20 subcaudal scales. The large number of subcaudal scales separates L. mbeerensis from all its congeners, among which L. lumbriciformis, with 17, has the next highest count. In addition, the new species is easily separated from several of its East African congeners by its lower number of midbody scale rows (20) versus 22 or more scale rows in L. gracilis (Sternfeld) (22–24), L. graueri (Sternfeld) (24), L. jubana Broadley & Wallach (24), L. largeni Broadley & Wallach (22), L. pallida Cope (22–24), L. pembana Broadley & Wallach (24), L. somalica (Boulenger) (24–30), L. sudanensis (Schmidt) (24– 27), L. swahilica Broadley & Wallach (22), and L. toritensis Broadley & Wallach (22–24). Several East African species formerly assigned to Letheobia (e.g., Broadley & Wallach 2007a) but now placed in Rhinotyphlops (R. ataeniata, R. scorteccii (Gans & Laurent 1965), R. unitaeniatus; see Hedges et al (2014) may also be distinguished by their greater number of mid-body scale rows (23–26). Letheobia mbeerensis may also be distinguished from most of its East African congeners by its high number of middorsal scales (670) versus lower numbers in L. erythraea (Scortecci) (443–462), L. graueri (454–622), L. jubana (391–435), L. largeni (432), L. pallida (418– 429), L. pembana (353), L. swahilica (376–396), L. toritensis (427–487), and L. uluguruensis (Barbour & Loveridge) (379–416) as well as Rhinotyphlops ataeniata (443–531), R. scorteccii (311–405), and R. unitaeniata (467–586).Letheobia mbeerensis is most similar to L. lumbriciformis, with which it shares similar body proportion (mean of 62.0 body diameters in total body length in L. lumbriciformis and 62.2 in the holotype of L. mbeerensis). However L. lumbriciformis has 18 midbody scale rows (versus 20 in L. mbeerensis). The new species may further be distinguished from L. lumbriciformis by having 670 middorsal scales (versus 465–607), a longer tail (2.9% of TL versus 1.3–1.7%; 20 versus 11–17 subcaudals), and eyes minute but visible (versus not visible).
Anilios zonula	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: A moderately slender and elongate Anilios, total length to 187 mm. Distinguished from all other congeners by a combination of midbody scales in 18 rows, total dorsal scales 446–482, dorsal body scales 431–471; snout bluntly rounded in dorsal and profile view (Fig. 2); rostral scale large and ovate about one-half of head width, with posterior edge terminating anterior to level of eyes; nasal scale divided, nostril positioned closer to rostral than preocular, distance between nostril and rostral about one- half of nostril width; nasal cleft originating from second supralabial, extending dorsally and anteriorly to reach nostril and thence anteriorly to reach rostral; eye inconspicuous, equal to or slightly smaller than width of nostril, positioned under preocular scale; tail tip bluntly rounded, terminal tail spine absent; coloration purplish–pink to pale pink, darkest anteriorly, gradually becoming lighter posteriorly.Coloration. In life (Fig. 1A in Ellis 2016), patternless, purplish–pink to pale pink, darkest anteriorly, gradually becoming lighter posteriorly; tail pale pink; snout and lower jaw to level of eyes pink, much lighter than crown and remainder of head to anterior body. In preservative (Fig. 1B,C), anterior half of body darker than posterior half, anterior half light cream to pale pink, snout slightly lighter, posterior half (including tail) pale cream to tan. Coloration uniform on dorsal, lateral, and ventral surfaces, no darker pigmentation on scales; eyes dark but inconspicuous.Variation. Only one additional specimen is available, the paratype (WAM R106250). The morphology of the paratype is consistent with the holotype; however, where variation occurs, the data are presented below for the paratype. Measurements and counts: SVL 154 mm; TailL 3.1 mm, 2.0% of SVL; MBW 2.4 mm; TDS 482; BDS 471; MBSR 18; SCS 11. Frontal approximately 1.25 times larger than postfrontal in area. Interparietal approximately 1.5 times the size of postfrontal. Parietals slightly narrower than supraoculars, widely separated by interparietal. Nasals narrowly separated by frontal, separation about one-fifth of frontal width. Eyes positioned in apex of preocular scale.Sexual dimorphism: unknown, as both known specimens are female.Comparison. Anilios zonula differs from 34 of the other 44 Anilios species in Australia by the number of MBSR (18 vs. 16, 20, 22, or 24), which, with the exception of A. leptosoma (16 or 18 MBSR), does not vary within any species of Anilios. It is further distinguishable from all remaining congeners except A. aspina by the lack of a terminal tail spine. Anilios zonula differs from A. aspina by having nasal divided, nasal cleft extending anteriorly to reach rostral from nostril and not visible in dorsal view (vs. extending dorsally, not reaching rostral and visible in dorsal view).Of the 10 congeners with 18 MBSR, A. zonula can be diagnosed by a combination of the following characteristics: DBS 446–482 (vs. .500 in A. grypus, A. guentheri, and A. leptosoma); snout bluntly rounded in dorsal view (vs. weakly trilobed in A. grypus, A. leptosoma, and A. margaretae) and bluntly rounded in profile view (vs. bluntly angular in A. affinis and A. margaretae, or beak-like and hooked in A. grypus); rostral scale ovate and not truncating anteriorly (vs. rostral ovate, truncating anteriorly in A. micromma, A. leptosoma, and A. grypus); nasal scale divided (vs. not completely dividing nasal in A. aspina, A chamodracaena, A. guentheri, and A. margaretae); eye equal to or smaller than width of nostril (vs. equal to or larger in A. affinis, A. aspina, A. grypus, A. guentheri, A. howi, A. margaretae, and A. yampiensis); nostril positioned closer to rostral than preocular, nasal cleft originating from second supralabial (vs. preocular in A. yampiensis) extending dorsally and anteriorly to reach nostril, then anteriorly to reach rostral; tail tip blunt and rounded, lacking terminal tail spine (vs. terminal tail spine present in A. affinis, A. chamodracaena, A. grypus, A. guentheri, A. howi, A. leptosoma, A. margaretae, A. micromma, and A. yampiensis); coloration darkest anteriorly, gradually becoming lighter posteriorly, and tail and/or head lacking any black pigmentation (vs. black pigment present on head and/or tail in A. grypus and A. guentheri).Of the 10 Anilios species known to occur in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, A. zonula can be diagnosed from five (A. diversus, A. kimberleyensis, A. ligatus, A. troglodytes, and A. ungirostris) by having midbody scales in 18 rows (vs. 16, 20, 22, or 24). Of the five species in the region with 18 MBSR, A. zonula differs from A. grypus in the lack of any dark brown or black pigment on the head or tail, lack of a hooked beak, and fewer DBS (,500 vs. .500). It differs from A. guentheri by the absence of any dark brown or black pigment on its head and tail and lack of terminal tail spine, fewer DBS (,500 vs. .500), and nasal cleft completely dividing nasal scale. It is further diagnosed from A. howi by the lack of dark brown or black pigmentation on the head or tail, eye equal to or smaller than width of nostril (vs. equal to or larger than width of nostril), path of nasal cleft from nostril, extending anteriorly to reach rostral scale (vs. cleft curving dorsally and anteriorly towards rostral), and lack of terminal tail spine.Within the Kimberley region of Western Australia, Anilios zonula is most similar to A. micromma and A. yampiensis. From A. micromma, the new species differs by the position of the nostril, positioned closer to rostral than preocular; distance from rostral approximately equal to width of nostril (vs. equidistant or closer to rostral but distance more than the width of nostril); path of nasal cleft, from nostril extending anteriorly to reach the rostral, and not visible in dorsal view (vs. extending dorsally and anteriorly, and visible from above in A. micromma); the lack of a terminal tail spine; and the size and shape of rostral scale, about one-half of head width at level of eyes (vs. about one-third of head width), not truncating anteriorly (vs. truncating anteriorly) with posterior edge not reaching the level of the eyes (vs. at level of eyes). From A. yampiensis, the new species differs by the origin of nasal cleft from second supralabial (vs. preocular); small eye, approximately equal to or smaller than width of nostril (vs. eye greater than width of nostril); lack of terminal tail spine; and rostral about one-half the width of head (vs. about one-third width of head) with posterior edge not reaching level of eyes (vs. at level of eyes).
Xerotyphlops luristanicus	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: A stout-bodied blind snake, small body size (maximum: 219 mm), moderate body form, short tail, rostral moderate. X. luristanicus sp. n. can easily be distinguished from all other Xerotyphlops species by the combination of the following characters: right side hemipenis in a single coil, left side curved, not straight; segmented testis; 22- 24 longitudinal scales rows; scale reduction present or not; 355-398 transverse scale rows at mid-body; 10-12 subcaudals; supralabial imbrication pattern T-III; parietal is apparently fused as there is no suture in the middle of this bone on the external side, on the internal side a groove is observed in this place; exoccipital is completely separated from supraoccipital; the dorsal body has strong uniform pigmentation throughout while in contrast all ventral scales lack pigmentation.
Anilios systenos	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: A moderately long, slender Anilios to about 270 mm total length. Distinguished from all other Anilios by a combination of midbody scales in 18 rows, dorsal body scales 598–621, snout bluntly angular in profile, tapering to a rounded point, snout tapering to a narrow rounded edge with faint trilobed appearance in dorsal view, hardened anterior rostral edge extending slightly ventrally to form a weak hook, nasal cleft originating from second supralabial, extending anteriorly to reach nostril and terminating at rostral scale, presence of a terminal tail spine, colouration pale with dorsum slightly darker than ventrum and lack of any black pigment on head, body or tail.Comparison with other species. Anilios systenos sp. nov. can be distinguished from 33 of the 45 described Anilios species by the number of midbody scale rows (18 vs 16, 20, 22 and 24), which does not vary within any Anilios species. Of the 11 Anilios species that also possess 18 MBSR (i.e. A. affinis, A. aspina, A. chamodracaena, A. grypus, A. guentheri, A. howi, A. margaretae, A. micromma, A. obtusifrons sp. nov., A. yampiensis and A. zonula), A. systenos sp. nov. can be distinguished based on the shape of the head in dorsal view, faintly trilobed and tapering to a rounded point anterior to rostral-nasal suture (vs bluntly rounded or rounded in A. affinis, A. aspina, A. chamodracaena, A. guentheri, A. micromma, A. obtusifrons sp. nov. and A. zonula) and bluntly angular in profile (vs rounded in A. aspina, A. guentheri, A. howi, A. micromma, A. obtusifrons sp. nov., A. yampiensis and A. zonula), absence of a prominent hooked beak (vs present in A. grypus), ovate rostral scale not narrowing anteriorly until beyond the nasal scale (vs elliptical in A. aspina, A. guentheri and A. howi), higher number of DBS (<560 in A. aspina, A. chamodracaena, A. howi, A. margaretae, A. micromma, A. yampiensis and A. zonula), origin of nasal cleft from second supralabial (vs preocular in A. yampiensis; first or preocular in A. grypus), termination of nasal cleft at rostral scale dividing nasal scale (vs not divided in A. aspina, A. chamodracaena, A. grypus, A. guentheri, A. margaretae and A. obtusifrons sp. nov.), nasal cleft not visible in dorsal view (vs visible for A. aspina and A. micromma), presence of a terminal tail spine (vs absent for A. aspina and A. zonula) and lack of any black colouration on head and/or tail (vs present for A. chamodracaena, A. grypus and A. guentheri).Six species are known or considered to possibly occur in sympatry with the species: A. australis, A. grypus, A. hamatus, A. leptosoma, A. obtusifrons sp. nov. and A. waitii. It differs from A. australis by its slender appearance (vs thicker stout appearance of A. australis), fewer MBSR (18 vs 22), higher number of DBS (598–621 vs 278– 357); from A. grypus by the lack of a prominent hooked beak and lack of any black pigment on head or tail; from A. hamatus by fewer MBSR (18 vs 22), higher DBS (598–621 vs 330–396), and from A. waitii by fewer MBSR (18 vs 20) and snout not strongly trilobed (prominently trilobed in A. waitii).Within its known distribution A. systenos sp. nov. is most similar in appearance to A. leptosoma and A. obtusifrons sp. nov. It differs from A. leptosoma by higher MBSR (18 vs 16) and a narrower and more pointed snout anterior to rostral-nasal suture in dorsal view. It differs from A. obtusifrons sp. nov. by greater number of DBS (598–621 vs 581–590), shape of snout in profile (tapering to a blunt point anterior to rostral-nasal suture vs bluntly rounded), presence of a hardened anterior and ventrally-facing rostral protrusion and termination point of nasal cleft (at rostral vs midway between nostril and rostral).
Anilios obtusifrons	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: A moderately long, slender Anilios to about 225 mm total length. Distinguished from all other Anilios by a combination of midbody scales in 18 rows, dorsal body scales 581–590, snout bluntly angular in profile, snout rounded in dorsal view, anterior rostral edge rounded and not hardened to form hook, nasal cleft originating from second supralabial, extending anteriorly to reach nostril and terminating midway between nostril and rostral scale, presence of a terminal tail spine, and colouration pale with anterior third slightly darker than posterior portion of body and lack of any black pigment on head, body or tail.Comparison with other species. Anilios obtusifrons sp. nov. can be distinguished from 33 of the 45 described Anilios species by the number of midbody scale rows (18 vs 16, 20, 22, and 24) which does not vary within any Anilios species. Of the 11 Anilios species that also possess 18 MBSR (i.e. A. affinis, A. aspina, A. chamodracaena, A. grypus, A. guentheri, A. howi, A. margaretae, A. micromma, A. systenos sp. nov., A. yampiensis and A. zonula), A. obtusifrons sp. nov. can be distinguished based on head rounded and faintly trilobed in dorsal view (vs strongly trilobed in dorsal view for A. margaretae; snout anterior to rostral-nasal suture in dorsal view bluntly rounded (vs tapering to a blunt point for A. systenos sp. nov.), the absence of a hardened anterior rostral edge forming a beak or hook (vs present in A. grypus and A. systenos sp. nov.), ovate rostral scale not narrowing anteriorly (vs elliptical in A. aspina, A. guentheri and A. howi), higher range of DBS (<560 in A. aspina, A. chamodracaena, A. howi, A. margaretae, A. micromma, A. yampiensis and A. zonula), origin of nasal cleft from second supralabial (vs preocular in A. yampiensis; first or preocular in A. grypus), dorsal termination of nasal cleft at mid-way between nostril and rostral scale (vs terminating at rostral and dividing nasal scale in A. affinis, A. grypus, A. howi, A. micromma, A. systenos sp. nov., A. yampiensis and A. zonula), nasal cleft not visible in dorsal view (vs visible for A. aspina and A. micromma), presence of a terminal tail spine (vs absent for A. aspina and A. zonula) and lack of any black colouration on head and/or tail (vs present for A. chamodracaena, A. grypus and A. guentheri).Six species are known or considered to possibly occur in sympatry with the species: A. australis, A. grypus, A. hamatus, A. leptosoma, A. systenos sp. nov. and A. waitii. It differs from A. australis by its slender appearance (vs thicker, stouter appearance of A. australis), fewer MBSR (18 vs 22), higher DBS (581–590 vs 278–357); from A. hamatus by fewer MBSR (18 vs 22), higher DBS (581–590 vs 330–396), unhooked snout and lack of hardened anterior protrusion (vs strongly hooked hardened anterior rostral edge), and from A. waitii by fewer MBSR (18 vs 20) and snout not strongly trilobed (strongly so in A. waitii).Within its known distribution, A. obtusifrons sp. nov. is most similar in appearance to A. leptosoma and A. systenos sp. nov. It differs from A. leptosoma by greater MBSR (18 vs 16), lower range of DBS (581–590 vs 583– 781) and termination of nasal cleft (midway between nostril and rostral vs rostral). Anilios obtusifrons sp. nov. is most similar in appearance to A. systenos sp. nov., differing by slightly lower range and average DBS (581–590, mean 586 vs 598–621, mean 609), shape of snout anterior to rostral-nasal suture in dorsal view (bluntly rounded vs tapering to a blunt point), absence of a slightly downward facing hardened anterior rostral edge and termination point of nasal cleft (midway between nostril and rostral vs at rostral).
Letheobia akagerae	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: The new species is assignable to the genus Letheobia for showing the following characters that in combination are diagnostic (Pyron & Wallach, 2014): Dorsal and lateral head profiles rounded; rostral broad; T-0; lateral snout profile rounded; body form gracile; eye invisible; coloration pink (pigmentless); body with 22 longitudinal scale rows without reduction; tail short with 13 subcaudals and apical spine; inferior nasal suture in contact with first supralabial; preocular in contact with second and third supralabials; subocular present. It extends the known total length/midbody width ratio in the genus (42–129; Pyron & Wallach, 2014) to 131 and the known maximum number of middorsal scale rows for any species in the genus (311–737; Broadley & Wallach, 2007; Pyron & Wallach, 2014) to 834. Comparison. Letheobia akagerae can be distinguished from all congeners by its unique middorsal scale count (834), which exceeds the known range for this character in the genus (311–737; Broadley & Wallach 2007; Pyron & Wallach 2014) considerably, and the extreme slenderness of its body with a total length/midbody width ratio of 130.7 (Fig. 5), which is outside the previously known range for the genus (42–129; Pyron & Wallach 2014). The non-reducing number of longitudinal scale rows (22) further separates the new species from L. acutirostrata (Andersson, 1916), L. graueri, L. jubana Broadley & Wallach, 2007, L. kibarae (de Witte, 1953), L. newtoni (Bocage, 1890), L. pembana Broadley & Wallach, 2007, L. praeocularis (Stejneger, 1894), L. somalica (Boulenger, 1895), L. stejnegeri (Loveridge, 1931), and L. sudanensis (Schmidt, 1923), all of which have at least 24 scale rows, and from L. debilis (Joger, 1990), L. episcopus (Franzen & Wallach, 2002), L. erythraea (Scortecci, 1928), L. lumbriciformis (Peters, 1874), L. mbeerensis Malonza, Bauer & Ngwava, 2016, L. rufescens (Chabanaud, 1916), and L. wittei (Roux-Estève, 1974), all of which have 21 or less scale rows (Pyron & Wallach 2014; Malonza et al. 2016). The total length of 457.5 mm exceeds the known maximum length for L. acutirostrata (447), L. caeca (Duméril, 1856) (443), L. crossii (Boulenger, 1893) (310), L. episcopus (318), L. erythraea (245), L. feae (Boulenger, 1906) (330), L. graueri (450), L. largeni Broadley & Wallach, 2007 (274), L. leucosticta (Boulenger, 1898) (230), L. lumbriciformis (445), L. mbeerensis (280), L. newtoni (400), L. pallida Cope, 1868 (192), L. pauwelsi Wallach, 2005 (310), L. pembana (158), L. praeocularis (438), L. simoni (Boettger, 1879) (239), L. swahilica Broadley & Wallach, 2007 (191), L. toritensis Broadley & Wallach, 2007 (268), L. uluguruensis (Barbour & Loveridge, 1928) (245), and L. wittei (310) (Pyron & Wallach 2014; Malonza et al. 2016). The rounded snout with a distinct angular horizontal edge of L. akagerae distinguishes the species from L. largeni, L. pallida, L. pembana, L. swahilica, L. toritensis, and L. uluguruensis, all of which have a prominent rounded snout without a horizontal edge, and from L. acutirostris and L. erythraea, which have a pointed snout (Broadley & Wallach 2007). The new species is superficially most similar to L. graueri and especially L. gracilis. Besides the aforementioned characters (elongation ratio and middorsal scale count) it differs from both species by having a posteriorly rounded rostral (vs. truncated in L. graueri and L. gracilis); the sides of the ventral part of rostral running almost parallel (vs. rostral continuously tapering from nostril in near-straight lines on both sides); the ocular being half the size of the supraocular (vs. about as large as supraocular); the ocular almost contacting the subocular (vs. ocular widely separated from subocular by temporal); posterior edges of rostral, nasal, preocular and subocular forming continuous line (vs. posterior edges of these scales not forming continuous line). Besides the aforementioned differences in maximum total length and number of longitudinal scale rows, the new species further differs from L. graueri in the second supralabial being about twice the size of the first supralabial (vs. second supralabial as large as first) and the fourth supralabial being larger than the third by a factor of 1.5 (vs. being smaller by the same factor). Letheobia akagerae further differs from L. gracilis in having a crescentic frontal (vs. frontal trapezoid), bordering the nasals (vs. separated from nasals by supraoculars) and being two-thirds width of rostral (vs. half width of rostral); inferior nasal suture arising from first supralabial (vs. arising from second supralabial) and four-fifths of ventral edge of preocular being bordered by second supralabial, one-fifth by supralabial (vs. about half of edge being bordered by second and third supralabial, respectively).
Letheobia weidholzi	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: Letheobia weidholzi can be separated from all other members of the genus by the following combination of characters: dorsal and lateral head profiles tapered or pointed with keratinous keel on rostral, lateral head shields obliquely oriented to the vertical, and more than 650 total middorsals. Additional characters distinguishing it from other Letheobia with pointed snouts are: inferior nasal suture in contact with sl 2, length/width ratio greater than 95, and absence of an apical spine. As to the assignment to the genus Letheobia, see Discussion (Wallach & Gemel 2018).Comparisons. reference to table 1 reveals that L. weidholzi is closest in scale counts to L. graueri (sterNFelD, 1913), and L. gracilis (sterNFelD, 1910), and closest in head profiles to L. acutirostrata (ANDerssON, 1916), and L. praeocularis (steJNeGer, 1894). Letheobia weidholzi differs from L. graueri (of uganda, tanzania and se Democratic republic of the Congo) in having an anterior scale row reduction (26-24-24 vs. 24-24-24), a higher number of mean total middorsal scales (651 vs. 535), a slightly more attenuate body (l/W ratio 96 vs. 58–89), a tapered dorsal head profile (vs. round), a pointed lateral head profile (vs. blunt), an elongate ocular shield (vs. small scale), and absence of an apical spine (vs. present). it differs from L. gracilis (of se Democratic republic of the Congo and Zambia) in the numbers of anterior and midbody scale rows (26 vs. 22–24 and 24 vs. 22), having fewer mean middorsal scale counts (651 vs. 685), a tapered dorsal head profile (vs. round), a pointed lateral head profile (vs. blunt), an elongate ocular shield (vs. small scale), and absence of an apical spine (vs. present). Letheobia weidholzi differs from L. acutirostris (of the Democratic republic of the Congo) in middorsal scale count (651 vs. 440–513, x ̅ = 477), inferior nasal suture contact (sl 2 vs. sl 1), and in absence of an apical spine (vs. present). it differs from L. praeocularis (of Democratic republic of the Congo and Angola) in number of middorsal scales (651vs. 423–545, x ̅ = 507), in orientation of lateral head shields (oblique vs. vertical), in having the preocular larger than the ocular (vs. smaller than ocular), and absence of an apical spine (vs. present).Within the borders of, or in proximity to, Cameroon are six species of Letheobia: L. caeca, L. crossii, L. decorosa, L. rufescens, L. zenkeri and an undescribed species (nov. sp. 2). Letheobia weidholzi can be distinguished from L. caeca by a greater number of middorsals (651 vs. 417–561, x ̅ = 493), fewer subcaudals (9 vs. 10–12), higher length/width ratio (96 vs. 46–87, x ̅ = 70), location of inferior nasal suture conact (sl 2 vs. r), and absence of apical spine (vs. present). it can be separated from L. crossii by having more total middorsals (651 vs. 455–513, x ̅ = 482), a larger length/width ratio (96 vs. 54–96, x ̅ = 71), a tapered dorsal profile (vs. pointed), and obliquely oriented lateral head shields (vs. vertically). Letheobia weidholzi can be identified in comparison with L. decorosa by anterior and posterior scale row reductions (vs. none), more total middorsals (651 vs. 460–542, x ̅ = 490), fewer subcaudals (9 vs. 10–12), a more attenuate body (l/W 96 vs. 45–66, x ̅ = 56), a broader rostral shield (rW/HW 0.71 vs. 0.59–0.67), location of contact of inferior nasal suture (sl 2 vs. r or sl 1), snout tapering or pointed in both profiles (vs. rounded or blunted), presence of a horizontal keratinous cutting edge to rostral (vs. absence), lateral head shield with oblique orientation (vs. vertical), preocular larger than ocular (vs. equal in size), and absence of apical spine (vs. present). Compared to L. rufescens, L. weidholzi can be identified by a greater number of scale rows (26-24-24 vs. 20-20-20 or 22-20-22), a t–0 supralabial imbrication pattern (vs. t–ii), a larger tail length ratio (1.1 % vs. 0.7–0.8 %), and tapered or pointed head profile (vs. rounded or blunted). Letheobia weidholzi can be separated from L. zenkeri by number of scale rows (26-24-24 vs. 20-18-18), total middorsals (651 vs. 250–281), total length (376 mm vs. 130–150 mm), length/width ratio (96 vs. 41–52), relative tail length (1.1 % vs. 1.7 %), relative rostral width (0.71 vs. 0.32), location of contact of infranasal suture (sl 2 vs. subocular), number of postoculars (3 vs. 1–2), head profiles (tapered/pointed vs. rounded), horizontal keratinous edge present on rostral (vs. absent), lateral head shield orientation (oblique vs. vertical), and preocular larger than ocular (vs. equal in size). From Letheobia nov. sp. 2, L. weidholzi can be distinguished by the numbers of midbody scale rows (24 vs. 22), total middorsals (651 vs. 451) and subcaudals (9vs. 12), total length (376 mm vs. 134 mm), length/width ratio (96 vs. 49), relative tail length (1.1 % vs. 1.5 %), relative rostral width (0.71 vs. 0.55), head profiles (tapered/pointed vs. rounded/blunted), horizontal keratinous keel on rostral (present vs. absent), eyespot (absent vs. present), and lateral head shield orientation (oblique vs. vertical) (Wallach & Gemel 2018).Diagnosis (logonensis): “Un Typhlopidé du genre Letheobia connu seulement par l’holotype. Il est caractérisé par la combinaison des caractères suivants : museau pointu en angle aigu vers l’avant, absence d’yeux apparents, grande rostrale nettement plus large que la frontale en vue dorsale, préoculaire plus grande que l’oculaire, 24 rangs d’écailles autour du corps, plus de 530 écailles longitudinales et moins de 10 sous-caudales, rapport entre la longueur totale et la longueur de la queue supérieur à 100, rapport entre la longueur totale et le diamètre du corps supérieur à 90.” (Trape 2019)Comparisons (logonensis): “L’aspect du museau, l’absence d’yeux apparents et les caractéristiques de l’écaillure, dont notamment la forme de la rostrale, inscrivent clairement cette espèce dans le genre Rhinotyphlops, sensu Roux-Estève (1974) et le genre Letheobia, sensu Broadley et Wallach (2007a). Sur les 33 espèces retenues dans le genre Letheobia par Wallach et al. (2014) et les trois espèces que ces auteurs conservent dans le genre Rhinotyphlops, seules cinq présentent ensemble les trois caractères suivants : museau en pointe aigüe dirigée vers l’avant, 24 rangs d’écailles autour du corps et plus de 500 écailles longitudinales. Il s’agit des espèces suivantes (Roux-Estève 1974, Broadley & Wallach 2007a, Pyron & Wallach 2014, Hedges et al. 2014) : Letheobia acutirostrata (Andersson, 1916), Letheobia caeca (Duméril, 1856), Letheobia crossii (Boulenger, 1893), Letheobia praeocularis (Stejneger, 1894) et Letheobia somalica (Boulenger, 1895). Parmi elles, L. praeocularis du sud du bloc forestier congolais et L. somalica de la corne de l’Afrique présentent un aspect des plaques céphaliques bien différent, avec notamment une oculaire sensiblement plus grande que la préoculaire alors que c’est l’inverse chez Letheobia logonensis sp. nov. Chez L. caeca –qui possède habituellement seulement 22 rangs d’écailles transversales – et chez L. acutirostrata, l’oculaire est minuscule, à peine plus grande que les écailles du corps, et la pointe du museau est légèrement surélevée par rapport au plan de la bouche, alors que l’oculaire est au moins quatre fois plus grande que les écailles du corps et la pointe du museau très surélevée chez Letheobia logonensis sp. nov. C’est de L. crossii d’Afrique de l’Ouest que Letheobia logonensis sp. nov. est le plus proche. Ces deux espèces présentent néanmoins plusieurs différences importantes : chez L. crossii la rostrale est étroite en vue dorsale et pas plus large que la frontale, la préoculaire est aussi large que l’oculaire, le nombre d’écailles longitudinales varie de 455 à 513 et celui de sous-caudales de 10 à 15, tandis que chez Letheobia logonensis sp. nov. la rostrale est deux fois plus large que la frontale, la préoculaire est nettement plus large que l’oculaire, le nombre d’écailles longitudinales dépasse 530 et le nombre de sous-caudales est inférieur à 10.” (Trape 2019).
Afrotyphlops chirioi	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: Un Typhlopidé de petite taille caractérisé par la combinaison des caractères suivants: museau arrondi, yeux invisibles, oculaire très large et haute, rapport entre la longueur totale et la longueur de la queue compris entre 26 et 39, rapport entre la longueur totale et le diamètre du corps compris entre 27 et 34, de 24 à 26 rangs d’écailles autour du corps, de 325 à 344 écailles longitudinales, spécimens préservés incolores.Comparaison avec d’autres espèces: Le fort rétrécissement ventral de la rostrale, la forme arrondie et sans bord corné du museau et le grand développement de l’oculaire permettent de rattacher cette espèce au genre Afrotyphlops en excluant notamment l’ensemble des espèces des genres Rhinotyphlops Fitzinger, 1843 (sensu Roux-Estève 1974) ou Letheobia Cope, 1869, qui sont volontiers aveugles et dépourvues de pigmentation mais dont aucune ne présente un développement de l’oculaire aussi important et dont le museau est habituellement pointu et cornu (Roux-Estève 1974, Broadley & Wallach 2007a, Hedges et al. 2014). Les deux espèces de Letheobia les moins éloignées d’Afrotyphlops chirio sp. nov. pour le développement de l’oculaire, Letheobia wittei (Roux-Estève, 1974) et Letheobia stejnegeri (Loveridge, 1931), ont toutes les deux plus de 450 écailles longitudinales et une forme de museau bien différente. Dans le genre Afrotyphlops il n’existe qu’un très petit nombre d’espèces aveugles et une seule espèce parmi ces dernières est totalement dépourvue de pigmentation : Afrotyphlops zenkeri (Sternfeld, 1908) du Cameroun qui possède une oculaire beaucoup plus petite que celle d’Afrotyphlops chirioi sp. nov., seulement 18 rangs d’écailles transversales et moins de 300 écailles longitudinales (Roux-Estève 1974). L’espèce aveugle la moins éloignée morphologiquement d’Afrotyphlops chirioi sp. nov. est Afrotyphlops coecatus (Jan, 1864) d’Afrique de l’Ouest mais cette espèce ne possède que 18 à 20 rangs d’écailles transversales (Roux-Estève 1974). Afrotyphlops decorosus (Buchholz & Peters, 1875), qui est également aveugle et souvent peu pigmenté, possède un nombre d’écailles longitudinales bien supérieur à celui d’Afrotyphlops chirioi sp. nov. (460 - 542 au lieu de 325 - 344). Afrotyphlops leucostictus (Boulenger, 1898) et Afrotyphlops manni (Loveridge, 1941), outre des écailles partiellement pigmentées, ont l’aspect de la nasale, de la préoculaire et de l’oculaire très différents de chez Afrotyphlops chirioi sp. nov. Afrotyphlops schmidti (Laurent, 1956) des savanes du sud du bloc forestier congolais est oculé et fortement pigmenté dorsalement (Roux-Estève 1974, Broadley & Wallach 2009).
Afrotyphlops rouxestevae	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: Un Typhlopidé du genre Afrotyphlops de grande taille connu seulement par l’holotype.

Anilios vagurima	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: A moderately slender and elongate Anilios to approximately 325 mm. Distinguished from all other congeners by a combination of midbody scales in 22 rows, 557 total dorsal scales, 542 dorsal body scales; snout moderately trilobed in dorsal view, bluntly rounded and elongate in profile; rostral scale narrowly bell-shaped, widest anteriorly at rostral-nasal suture, ~40% of head width, with posterior edge terminating well before eye line; nasal scale partially divided, offset nostril positioned slightly closer to rostral than preocular; nasal cleft originating at the second supralabial and arcs anterodorsally to the nostril and then posterodorsally to lie nearly parallel to rostral-nasal suture within the apex of nasal scale, where it is clearly visible in dorsal view; and contrasting dorsal and ventral colouration.COMPARISON WITH OTHER SPECIES: Anilios vagurima sp. nov. differs from 36 of the 46 native Australian Anilios species and introduced Indotyphlops braminus by its number of MBSR (22 vs. 16, 18, 20 or 24), which does not vary within any Anilios species. Of the ten congeners with 22 MBSR (A. australis, A. bicolor, A. endoterus, A. hamatus, A. kimberleyensis, A. nigrescens, A. pilbarensis, A. robertsi, A. torresianus, A. troglodytes), A. vagurima can be diagnosed by a combination of the following; DBS 552 (vs. <525 in A. kimberleyensis or <450 in A. australis, A. bicolor, A. endoterus, A. hamatus, A. kimberleyensis, A. nigrescens, A. pilbarensis and A. torresianus), snout moderately trilobed in dorsal view (vs. weakly trilobed in A. endoterus, A. hamatus and A. pilbarensis or rounded in A. australis, A. kimberleyensis, A. nigrescens, A. robertsi, A. torresianus and A. troglodytes) and narrowly rounded in profile (vs. angular in A. bicolor, A. endoterus, A. hamatus or beaked in A. pilbarensis), rostral scale bell- shaped, ~40% of head width (vs. broadly to narrowly subovate, circular or elliptical in A. australis, A. bicolor, A. endoterus, A. hamatus, A. kimberleyensis, A. nigrescens, A. pilbarensis, A. robertsi, A. torresianus, A. troglodytes), nasal scale partially divided vertically by nasal cleft (vs. divided in A. troglodytes and sometimes divided in A. endoterus) and unique origin (second supralabial vs. preocular in A. endoterus, A. nigrescens and A. pilbarensis or sometimes at junction of first and second supralabial in A. australis, A. hamatus and A. torresianus), path from nostril (extending dorso-posterior direction, nearly parallel to rostral-nasal suture vs. anterior or dorso-anterior direction towards rostral in A. australis, A. bicolor, A. endoterus, A. hamatus, A. nigrescens, A. pilbarensis, A. robertsi) and termination point (apex of nostril scale vs. nostril, midway between nostril and rostral or at rostral in A. australis, A. bicolor, A. endoterus, A. hamatus, A. nigrescens, A. pilbarensis, A. robertsi and A. troglodytes) of nasal cleft, and nasal cleft clearly visible in dorsal view (vs. only just in A. robertsi or not visible in A. australis, A. bicolor, A. endoterus, A. hamatus and A. pilbarensis).Of the 11 Anilios species known to occur in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, A. vagurima can be diagnosed from nine (A. diversus, A. grypus, A. guentheri, A. howi, A. ligatus, A. micromma, A. unguirostris, A. yampiensis and A. zonula) in having 22 MBSR (vs. 18, 20 or 24). Of the two species in the region with 22 MBSR (A. kimberleyensis and A. troglodytes), A. vagurima differs from A. kimberleyensis in having moderately trilobed snout in dorsal view (vs. rounded), narrowly rounded in profile (vs. bluntly rounded), higher number of DBS (542 vs. <510), path of nasal cleft upwards and towards rostral slightly, almost parallel to rostral-nasal suture, terminating ~midway between rostral and preocular (vs. upwards and backwards and gradually closer to rostral-nasal suture towards terminus, with slightly recurved terminus towards rostral, terminating closer to rostral than preocular), nasal suture closest to rostral approximately midway between nostril and terminus (vs. at cleft terminus). It differs from A. troglodytes in having moderately trilobed snout in dorsal view (vs. rounded), fewer DBS (542 vs. >580), path of nasal cleft from nostril extending upwards and towards rostral slightly, almost parallel to rostral-nasal suture, terminating ~midway between rostral and preocular (vs. upwards and forwards to, or nearly to, rostral scale).Within the Kimberley region of Western Australia, Anilios vagurima sp. nov. is most similar in appearance to A. kimberleyensis and A. unguirostris in general appearance. The type specimen of A. vagurima sp. nov. keys out to A. kimberleyensis using keys provided in Cogger (2018) and Storr et al. (2002); however, it is clearly distinguished from A. kimberleyensis as discussed above. With A. unguirostris, A. vagurima sp. nov. shares a moderately slender body form, contrasting dorsal and ventral colouration along body length and moderately trilobed snout in dorsal view; however, it differs in having fewer midbody scale rows (22 vs. 24), rounded snout lacking hook in profile (vs. hooked), nasal cleft originating from second supralabial (vs. first), from nostril extending upwards and backwards to top of head, parallel to rostral scale (vs. upwards and forwards to or nearly to rostral) and clearly visible from above (vs. not or scarcely).
Xerotyphlops syriacus	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	According to Jan, the main diagnostic character between syriacus and vermicularis was the nasal furrow that did not surpass the nostril in the former while it did in the latter (fide Kornilios et al. 2020 who state that this is character not diagnostic but they do NOT provide any revised diagnosis either).
Madatyphlops eudelini	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis: Madatyphlops eudelini sp. nov. is diagnosed by the following combination of characters: Maximum known total length 190.7 mm; dorsal coloration dark with a cream-white band of the width of two scale rows along the mid-venter; scales around midbody 24; total middorsal scales 414–418; subcaudal scales 15. Assigned to the genus Madatyphlops based on molecular genetic data, i.e., placement as sibling taxon of M. comorensis nested within the clade of Madatyphlops, and on the agreement of the morphological characters studied (Table 1) with the diagnosis of Madatyphlops given in Hedges et al. (2014), and Pyron and Wallach (2014) (Hawlitschek et al., 2021). Comparisons: The following diagnosis is based on previously published comparative data (Renoult and Raselimanana, 2009; Wallach and Glaw, 2009; Wegener et al., 2013) and data collected for this study (Table 1). Madatyphlops eudelini sp. nov. differs from all other Comoran and most Malagasy species of blindsnakes (except several specimens of the M. microcephalus complex) by its dark dorsal coloration combined with a cream-white band of the width of two scale rows along the mid-venter, broader under chin and tail. It further differs from the syntopic Indotyphlops braminus by more scales around midbody (24 vs. 20), larger maximum total length (up to 191 mm vs. up to ca. 180 mm); and from the Malagasy Xenotyphlops grandidieri by more scales around midbody (24 vs. 20–22), dorsal coloration (black vs. pink), and head morphology (visible eyes vs. no eyes, lack of enlarged head plate, and skull morphology; Chretien et al., 2019). It differs from the other Madatyphlops species as follows: by more scales around midbody (24) from M. ocularis (20), M. microcephalus (20), M. reuteri (20), M. boettgeri (20–21), M. comorensis (22), M. domerguei (22), and several populations of the M. arenarius complex (20); and by fewer scales around midbody from M. andasibensis (24 vs. 26), M. decorsei (26–28), and some populations of M. mucronatus (24–28). Madatyphlops eudelini sp. nov. differs from M. rajeryi by dorsal coloration (black vs. yellowish-gray), smaller maximum total length (191 vs. 272 mm), and smaller midbody diameter (2.7–4.0 vs. 7.4 mm); from M. madagascariensis by a lower number of total middorsal scales (414–418 vs. 580), smaller maximum total length (191 vs. 410 mm), and the presence of distinct eyes (vs. invisible); from M. arenarius by dorsal coloration (black vs. pink), eye coloration (pale vs. black); and from M. mucronatus by a lower number of total middorsal scales (414–418 vs. 488–577), smaller maximum total length (191 vs. 418 mm), and smaller midbody diameter (2.7–4.0 vs. 3.0–8.5 mm). It differs from M. albanalis by smaller maximum total length (up to 191 mm vs. 270 mm), more scales around midbody (24 vs. 20), and rostral not protruding vs. strongly protruding. The geographical origin of M. albanalis and its assignment to Madatyphlops are dubious (Wallach et al., 2014). The attribution of M. cariei, which is known only from seven subfossil trunk vertebrae from Mauritius, is unclear, and we are unable to provide any diagnosis with the available data (Wallach et al., 2014). There are no osteological descriptions of any other Madatyphlops species available. Therefore, we can compare the skull of the new species only to that of M. comorensis. From that species, it differs only subtly in the shape of the groove in the septomaxilla and in the concavities of the vidian canal in the basisphenoid (see above). The skulls of these snakes are highly conserved but show substantial ontogenetic shape change (Hawlitschek et al., 2021).Color in life: Color in preservative dorsally and laterally overall dark brown. Scales transparent. Venter with cream-white medial band of the width of two scale rows, broadening under head and tail (Hawlitschek et al., 2021).
