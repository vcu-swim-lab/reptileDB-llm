Boa constrictor	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis (constrictor in Honduras): “Boa constrictor differs from all other Honduran snakes by the combination of having enlarged ventral scales that do not extend the entire width of the venter, no enlarged scales on the top of the head, mostly entire subcaudal scales, smooth dorsal scales in more than 60 rows at midbody, a huge adult size, and in lacking labial pits.” (McCranie 2011: 61)Detailed description (constrictor): McCranie 2011: 62Diagnosis (longicauda)”: Boa constrictor longicauda may be distinguished from all conspecifics by the much longer tail (in the male) and hemipenis. Additionally, it may be distinguished from B. c. imperator by fewer dorsal body bloches (20-21 in longicauda, 22 or more in imperator), the longitudinal mid-dorsal band without projections to the eyes, and the generally darker head and body coloration, without tan or red color on the tail in adults; from B. c. constrictor by lack of red coloration on the tail, fewer midbody scale rows (a maximum of 76, usually fewer in longicauda, a minimum of 81, usually several more in constrictor), the darker body pattern without tan color, and the grey, black-spotted head in adults; from B. c. ortonii by the much darker overall coloration, lack of red tail color and lower ventral count (246-252 in ortonii); from B. c. melanogaster (sensu Langhammer, 1983) by the much longer tail, lack of melanistic ventral coloration, and fewer middorsal scale rows (86 or more in melanogaster); from B. c. amarali by the overall darker coloration, greater number of subcaudals (43-52 in amarali), and fewer dorsal body saddles (22 or more in amarali); and from B. c. occidentalis by the greater number of subcaudals (45-46 in occidentalis), and the very different color patterns (a blackish network or reticulum on a cream ground color in occidentalis) [from Price & Russo 1991].Diagnosis (orophias): A Constrictor with a prominent snout and a convex canthus; 65 to 75 dorsal scale rows at midbody, 270 to 288 ventrals, and 27 to 31 distinct, subrectangular, dark dorsal saddles to the level of the anus; dorsal ground color rich brown; venter white with black or grey spotting pronounced; subocular stripe distinct and complete; loreal stripe largely obsolete; dark pigment on chin and infralabials not closely corresponding to the facial stripes [Lazell 1964: 261].
Sanzinia madagascariensis	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis (family Sanziniidae). Sanziniids can be distinguished from all other similar or related taxa by the following combination of characters: mineralized internarial septum presenting only a small fenestra, postorbital and frontal broadly separated by the parietal, distal border of the optic foramen formed mostly by the parietal with anterior margin formed by the frontal, apex of the coronoid extends well above the surangular, lateroventral ledge of the surangular restricted to the anterior region, posterior trunk intercostal arteries supply one body segment each, hemipenis with longitudinal flounce, and sulcus terminating below the tips of the arms (see Kluge 1993, Pyron et al. 2014). Description: “Rostral as broad as deep, just visible from above, followed by two or three pairs of small shields, the anterior of which separate the nasals; the rest of the upper surface of the head covered with small, convex, tubercular scales: some of the scales above the eye may coalesce to form a supraocular shield; 8 to 11 scales across the forehead, from eye to eye; 13 to 15 upper labials, one, two, or three of which enter the eye, with deep pits between them ; all the lower labials deeply pitted. Scales in 41 to 53 rows. Ventrals 200-234 : anal entire; subcaudals 30-48. Coloration: Brown or olive above, with two longitudinal series of large roundish or rhomboidal dark brown spots with yellow centre and border : an oblique dark brown streak on each side from the eye to the angle of the mouth; lower parts yellow, uniform or with small brown spots.Total length: 1300 millim. ; tail 130.” (Boulenger 1893: 103)
Calabaria reinhardtii	Serpentes	Boidae	Description: There are normally 3 pairs of shields between the frontal and large rostral. On eight specimens an azygous prefrontal is added, and in one specimen there are two azygous shields. There is uniformly a single preocular and two supraoculars. The post-oculars are normally 2 on each side, 2-3 in three specimens, 3-3 in one. The temporals are 3 or 4 in the first row, 4 or 5 in the second. Upper labials 8, third and fourth entering the eye, or frequently the fourth only, third and fourth fused in one specimen, lower labials 9-11.The scale formula lies between 28-35-28 and 26-32-25. The normal scale count appears to he 28-33-27. The ventrals number from 221 to 234, and the subcaudals from 19 to 27 (Schmidt 1923)Sexual dimorphism: The sexes are not readily distinguished by the form of the tail, but the claws at each corner of the base are externally visible only in the males (Schmidt 1923).Coloration: “The general color is dark brown with irregular lighter markings. These become yellowish pink on the sides, and the venter is brown, marked with pink. Tip of head and tail nearly black. Some specimens have a milky white band around the tail about 20 nim. from its tip, still further increasing its superficial resemblance to the head (H. Lang, cited in Schmidt 1923).Eyes: Iris brown, pupil vertically elongate (H. Lang, cited in Schmidt 1923).
Candoia aspera	Serpentes	Boidae	Detailed description: McDowell 1979: 51 ff.
Candoia bibroni	Serpentes	Boidae	Scalation: 207-259 ventral scales, 31-41 midbody scale rows, 47-62 subcaudals. Loyalty Island snakes have scale counts that are typically at the high end ofthe species range (Bauer & Sadlier 2000: 222).Color:Typically brownish, reddish brown, or olive with large black dorsal markings and smaller white spots. Venter grayish or more brightly colored (yellow to orangish red) (Bauer & Sadlier 2000: 222).Variation: Pemales are larger than males. Spurs are present in all males and many females, but are much larger in males (Harlow and Shine 1992). Roux (1913) and McDowell (1979) noted significant inter-island variation in midbody and ventral scale row counts in the Loyalties, low counts typify Ouvéan populations, whereas Lifou specimens have the highest counts. Bavay (1869) noted extensive individual color variation with sorne specimens nearly uniform in color and others strongly marked with a black pattern on the dorsum. Parallel black lines are present on the ventral scales ventromedially in the Maré and Ouvéa populations. Black dashes ventrolaterally are typical of Lifou specimens (Bauer & Sadlier 2000: 222).Comparison with other species: No other large terrestrial snakes occur in the New Caledonian region. It is the longest and most slender species of Candoia and the large number of ventral scales distinguish it from congeners (Bauer & Sadlier 2000: 222).Size: SVL460-1460 mm (mean 720.5 for males, 983.1 for females) (Harlow and Shine 1992).Detailed morphological description: McDowell 1979: 12 ff.

Charina bottae	Serpentes	Boidae	Definition (genus). Charina is a small boa (maximal total length, 800 mm) with a short, blunt tail capped by a rounded plate. The head is not distinct from the neck and has large, irregular plates on the dorsal surface. The snout is short, broad, and slightly depressed. The eye is small with a vertical pupil. Chin scales are small, without enlarged plates. Dorsal scales are small, width subequal to length, smooth, and in 32-53 rows. Ventrals range from 182-231. Subcaudals are in a single series, 24-43 in number. The anal plate is entire. The hemipenis is single, clavate and transversely plicate with an apically forked sulcus. The basal portion is smooth. Pelvic spurs are present in both sexes, smaller in females, and often difficult to see. The dorsum typically is uniform in color, ranging from olive green to camel tan, reddish-brown, medium brown and dark chocolate brown. The venter is yellowish and may be mottled with orange or brown. The young generally are pink to tan above and light yellow to cream below. (Stewart 1977)DEFINITION (bottae). A subspecies characterized by relatively high scale counts (dorsals 39-53, x̅ ≈ 44; ventrals 188-231,  x̅ ≈ 206; sub-caudals 24-43,  x̅ ≈ 36), frontal plate usually with distinctly convex or angular posterior margin, large size (average total length over 400 mm), and dark dorsal color (adults usually olive green to medium brown in life). (Stewart 1977)
Lichanura trivirgata	Serpentes	Boidae	Definition (genus). Lichanura is a medium-sized (430-1120 mm total length), heavy-bodied boa with an elongated head slightly distinct from the neck and a short, tapered, slightly prehensile tail. The eye is small, with a vertical pupil and a circumocular ring of 7-11 scales. The dorsal head scutes are small, except on snout. Chin shields and mental groove are absent. Dorsal scales are small, smooth, and in 35-45 rows. Ventrals are narrow and range from 218-244; subcaudals are single and number 39-51. The anal plate is entire. Small pelvic spurs occur in both sexes, but are larger in males. The hemipenis is simple, with a forked sulcus and a smooth apex and basal portion; the lamina are pinnate from the sulcus. The dorsal ground color varies from cream to bluish gray, beige or pale gray. Three reddish, brown, or black longitudinal stripes may be present, or the stripe color may partly to completely cover the dorsum. The venter is cream, yellowish, or gray, variously spotted with gray or brown. The young are similar, but usually lighter and with a more distinct pattern. (Yingling 1982)Definition (gracia): “A subspecies of Lichanura trivirgata with 3 serrate-edged reddish-brown or tan stripes on a gray or tan dorsum. Little or no spotting is present between stripes.” (Yingling 1982)Definition (roseofusca): “A subspecies of Lichanura trivirgata with either 3 irregularly-edged pink to dull brown stripes on a bluish-gray dorsum, often with spotting between the stripes, or partial to total obliteration of pattern by stripe color.” (Yingling 1982)Key to species: Stejneger 1889: 98 (who recognized 5 forms: trivirgata, myriolepis, simplex, orcutti, roseofusca).
Corallus annulatus	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis: Corallus annulatus is distinguishable from members of the C. hortulanus complex (C. cookii, C. grenadensis, C. hortulanus, C. ruschenbergerii) by the combination of presence or absence of nasal contact (usually contact in C. hortulanus complex, usually not in C. annulatus) and number of sub-caudals (94–137 in C. hortulanus complex, 79–88 in C. annulatus). It is distinguishable from C. cropanii on the basis of maximum number of dorsal scale rows (<35 in C. cropanii, 50–57 in C. annulatus), and from C. caninus by the maximum number of dorsal scale rows (63–77 in C. caninus), and ventrals (251–268 in C. annulatus, 186–209 in C. caninus). It differs from C. blombergi in dorsal ground color (usually beige to red-brown in C. annulatus, usually milk chocolate brown to rich dark brown in C. blombergi); dorsal blotches 6–12 (usually 9–10) scales wide at midbody in C. annulatus [6–9 (usually 7–8) in C. blombergi]; central area of dorsal blotches more or less same shade as dorsal ground color in C. annulatus (distinctly paler than dorsal ground color in C. blombergi); infraloreals + loreals usually 8–9 in C. annulatus (usually 6 in C. blombergi); anterior edge of splenial hooked in C. annulatus (gradually tapering anteroventrally in C. blombergi); and coronoid in contact with the angular in C. annulatus (separated in C. blombergi) [HENDERSON et al. 2001].
Corallus caninus	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis: Distinguishable from all other species of Corallus (except C. batesii) based on its green dorsal ground color with enamel-white markings on the dorsum (dorsum occasionally immaculate green, devoid of any white markings); juveniles usually red-orange (rarely green) with enamel-white markings (other species of Corallus have dorsal ground colors of various shades of gray, brown, red, and yellow as adults, always with patterns consisting of more than just white markings). It differs from C. batesii by reduced number of scales across snout at level of the suture between third and fourth supralabials (2–6, mean = 3.4 +/- 1.1 in C. caninus; 3–12, mean = 6.9 +/- 1.6 in C. batesii), absence of mid-dorsal longitudinal stripe (present or absent in C. batesii), and absence or near-absence of lateral blotches (0–11, mean = 1.3 +/- 2.7 in C. caninus; 0–38, mean = 18.1 +/- 8.2 in C. batesii). Juvenile dorsal coloration (in alcohol) pale yellow to beige (in life, red-orange) in specimens 380– 516 mm SVL. Mitochondrial DNA sequence differences between Guiana Shield samples (C. caninus) and those from Amazonia (C. batesii) ranged from 3.1–16.2% (Vidal et al., 2005). [from HENDERSON eta l. 2009].
Corallus cookii	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis: Corallus cooki is most easily distinguished from other members of the C. hortulanus complex by its color pattern. It lacks the color variation (pale yellow, orange, red, many shades of brown) found in C. hortulanus and C. grenadensis. Likewise, the main element of the dorsal pattern is relatively constant, and it rarely occurs in populations outside of St. Vincent. The diamond-shape pattern characteristic of C. ruschenbergerii does not occur in this species. Corallus cooki is distinguishable from C. hortulanus by maximum number of dorsal scale rows: invariably less than 50 in C. cooki (39–48; x = 43.9 +/- 0.34) and almost always more than 50 in C. hortulanus (47– 63; x = 55.0 +/- 0.17; specimens with less than 50 occur occasionally in Guyana, Suriname, Bolivia, and Peru) [from HENDERSON 1997].
Corallus cropanii	Serpentes	Boidae	Description (genus Xenoboa): “This new genus is characterized by having the anterior teeth strongly enlarged; labials and rostral with deep pits; tail short, prehensil; dorsal scales very large and smooth; hemipenis with papillous apex. Xenoboa is related to Boa L. and Epicrates Wagler but differs from Epicrates by the type of dentition and the deep pits, and from Boa by the very large scales and shorter tail.” (Hoge 1953)Original description: “Body stout, a little compressed laterally, tail short prehensil; head distinct from neck, covered with shields; rostral with a pit on each side; supraoculars a little enlarged; supralabials 14-13 with deep pits; a large preocular, eye surrounded by 9 scales: ventrals 179; dorsals in 30 series at midbody; anal single; caudals 1+-3/3+48; body+head 1113 mm.; tail 167 mm.; head 54 mm.. Coloration: Body olive-green with rhomboidal dorsal blotches (Fig. 4) and a series of irregular spots on the sides (Fig. 4). Belly yellow, anterior part with small black edges on each ventral. The black edges increasing in size tailwards (Fig. 5). Hemipenis with plicae, papilous at the apex, 'sulcus spermaticus" forked. Skull: nasals thrice as long as broad; prefrontal broader than long; --postfrental-not-in-contact-with-frontal,-which-is-broader-than-long;mandibular with 15 teeth, anterior strongly enlarged; palatine without processus and with 5 teeth; pterigoid with 5 teeth. The skull is much shorter land broader than in Boa or Epicrates.” (Hoge 1953)
Corallus hortulana	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis: Corallus hortulanus is distinguishable from other species in the complex by the maximum number of dorsal scale rows (almost always over 50 in hortulanus, always less than 50 in cooki, grenadensis, and ruschenbergerii). Populations of hortulanus with less than 50 dorsal scale rows occur in Guyana, Suriname, Bolivia, and Peru. In general, hortulanus has higher counts for meristic characters than other members of the complex. The shape of the main element in the dorsal pattern at midbody is more or less ellipsoidal, whereas it is a ragged hourglass in cooki and is usually spade-shaped in grenadensis [from HENDERSON 1997].
Corallus ruschenbergerii	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis: Corallus ruschenbergerii is easily distinguished from all other species of Corallus except C. grenadensis. The maximum number of dorsal scale rows in C. cropanii is fewer than 35 (38–48 in C. ruschenbergerii). Corallus annulatus, the only congener with which there is significant sympatry, has a maximum of 50–57 dorsal scale rows and only 79–87 subcaudals (94–115 in C. ruschenbergerii). Corallus caninus has a maximum of 63–77 dorsal scale rows, and 186–209 ventrals (250–272 in C. ruschenbergerii). With very few exceptions, C. hortulanus from mainland South America and Ilha Grande off southeastern Brazil have 50 or more maximum dorsal scale rows (individuals from Guyana, Suriname, Peru, and Bolivia rarely have 47 or 48) and color and pattern are extremely variable.Corallus from St. Vincent and the Grenada Bank are the shortest and most slender of the Neotropical tree boas, and this can be related to aspects of their ecology (see below). They exhibit great overlap in lepidosis with C. ruschenbergerii, but C. ruschenbergerii is much larger (maximum SVL in West Indian Corallus is 1625 mm), and C. grenadensis exhibits tremendous color and pattern variation. Despite the pattern variation in the West Indian populations, none of it duplicates that found in C. ruschenbergerii, with the exception of yellow-brown individuals that have no discernible pattern [from HENDERSON 1997].
Chilabothrus angulifer	Serpentes	Boidae	DESCRIPTION: Maximum SVL approaches 4000 mm (although Gundlach, 1880, reported specimens of 5-7 yds. total length); dorsal scale rows at midbody 53-69; ventrals 272-292 in males, 268-290 in females; subcaudals 45-55 in males, 46-54 in females; ventrals + subcaudals 321-347 in males, 316-339 in females; supralabials separated from eye; head scale formula* 3-3-4. Dorsal pattern of 42-65 appressed, angulate, dark brown to black markings on a yellowish to yellow-tan ground, but often (western Cuba) without any dark colors in dorsal pattern, and pattern composed of indeterminate number of medium brown to pale tan, much-fused markings; tail patternless above, or with up to 12 darker dorsal markings (Schwartz & Henderson 1991: 601).
Epicrates cenchria	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis: Distinguished from all continental species of Epicrates by having: (1) noncollapsed lateral ocelli, (2) dorsal ground color pale to yellow reddish, (3) SVL . 1500 mm, (4) lateral process of surangular much expanded latero-posteriorly. Additionally, E. cenchria differ from E. crassus, E. maurus, and E. assisi by having alary process of vomer laterally expanded; from E. crassus and E. maurus, by having ventral scales . 245; from E. crassus by having subcaudal scales generally . 45; from E. alvarezi by having inverted hemipenis bifurcates at fifth and extends to the level of tenth subcaudal.

(Leviton et al. 1992)
Eryx johnii	Serpentes	Boidae	Description: Rostral large, broader than high, well visible from above, with angular horizontal edge; nostril slit-like, betweeh two enlarged nasals usually two pairs of broad scales behind the rostral the other scales on the top of the head in front of the eyes being larger than those posterior to them 6 to 9 scalee across the forehead between the eyes 10 or 11 scales round the eye; sometimes two series of scales separating the eye from the labials, which are from 10 to 12 in number; a mental groove. Scales in 53 to 67 rows, more or less distinctly keeled. V. 190-210; C. 20-34; anal. entire, small. Tail blunt, covered at the tip with a large rounded shield. (Smith 1943)
Eryx miliaris	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis: GL bis 810 mm, damit etwas kleiner als die beiden semisympatrischen Arten E. jaculus und E. tataricus bleibend. Von diesen beiden unterscheidet sich E. miliaris neben Pholidose- und Färbungsmerkmalen vor allem durch die Stellung der Augen, die nicht nach seitlich, sondern nach oben ausgerichtet sind (Abb. 10) (Darevsky in Böhme et al. 1993: 55).
Exiliboa placata	Serpentes	Boidae	DIAGNOSIS (GENUS): “A small, nearly unicolored, prehensile-tailed boa, characterized by its possession of a large azygous internasal in broad contact with the rostral, and flanked on each side by a single nasal. This peculiar configuration of the scales readily distinguishes Exiliboa from Ungaliophis and from Tropidophis, al members of which have paired internasals and divided nasal plates (fig. 1). Exiliboa retains a pair of prefrontals in contrast to the azygous prefrontal of Ungaliophis, and the two pairs of prefrontals normally present on Tropidophis. The loreal is retained by Exiliboa, whereas it is absent from, or fused with the anterior prefrontal of, Tropidophis. The mental groove of Exiliboa is bordered by only three pairs of shields, but the groove is bordered by four scales in Ungaliophis and by four or five in Tropidophis. Furthermore, the female of Exiliboa differs from that of other dwarf boas in its retention of external vestiges of limbs. “ (Bogert 1968) Comparisons (genus): “Trachyboa, an inhabitant of lowland forests in northern South America and Panama, is more distantly related, although it resembles Exiliboa in having the nostril in an undivided nasal, and it possesses comparable numbers of ventrals and subcaudals. Most of the cephalic plates have been replaced by scales on Trachyboa, which differs further in having from 29 to 31 rows of scales at midbody, in contrast to 21 on Exiliboa. Moreover, well-developed hypapophyses are present on al vertebrae of Trachyboa, but lacking on the precaudal vertebrae of Exiliboa. Trachyboa is an extremely rugose snake, adaptively specialized to forage on the surface (Bogert, 1968), unlike the comparatively slender, smooth-scaled dwarf boa from Oaxaca, which is evidently semifossorial.” (Bogert 1968)DEFINITION OF THE GENUS: “Exiliboa is a relatively small member of the family Boidae, with over-all dimensions that may not greatly exceed 50 cm. The trunk is les strongly compressed toward the constriction behind the head. The more strongly compressed prehensile tail, which comprises slightly more than 10 per cent of the total length, terminates in a blunt spine. Spurs, present on the female (fig. 2), are presumably more strongly developed on males. The large rostral is in broad contact posteriorly with a large undivided internasal, and on each side the rostral is followed by an undivided nasal containing the nostril. There is a pair of prefrontals, and the frontal is flanked by the supraoculars and the scalelike vestiges of the parietals. In addition to the single nasal on each side of the head, there are a loreal, a preocular, two postoculars, and seven supralabials, two of which enter the orbit. On the under side of the head the first supralabials meet on a broad suture separating the large mental from a pair of small chin-shields. The mental groove is bordered by the first supralabials and two pairs of chin-shields. The dorsal scales are smooth, in 19 rows anteriorly, but increasing to 21 at midbody and diminishing to 15 at the vent. The anal plate and sub-caudals are undivided. The iris is black, and the vertical pupil is semi-elliptic,as shown infigure3.The tongue is black and relatively short. From 17 to 19 teeth are present on the maxilla, 19 on the dentary; the teeth are relatively long and slender anteriorly, but progressively smaller toward the rear. Hypapophyses are restricted to a few vertebrae at the anterior end of the trunk. The tracheal lung is followed by the right lung, without any demarcation between them. There is no vestige of the left lung. The kidneys are lobulated, and situated well toward the rear of the body cavity.” (Bogert 1968)DIAGNOSIS (species): “As noted in the discussion of generic characters, the boas of the genera Ungaliophis and Tropidophis appear to be the nearest living relatives of the dwarf boa discovered in Oaxaca. The peculiarities of Exiliboa that serve to distinguish it from these other genera, therefore, are also diagnostic of E. placata. The species differs from al other boas in Mexico in having the scales arranged in 21 rows at midbody, and in having a large azygous internasal that extends across the snout to an undivided nasal and the anterior portion of the loreal on each side. The number of midbody scale rows varies from 19 to 25 in Ungaliophis, but Mexican representatives of the genus have 25; many more scale rows are present on Loxocemus, Lichanura, and Boa, the only other genera of the family Boidae known to occur in Mexico.” (Bogert 1968)DESCRIPTION OF THE HOLOTYPE: “A female,possibly immature,withan over-all length of 412 mm., and a tail 45 mm. in length that comprises 10.9 per cent of the total length. The head is 14.5 mm. in length and 8.0 mm. in width, and the diameter of the trunk behind the head is 5.0 mm. The trunk is increasingly more compressed toward the base of the tail, where it is appreciably higher than wide. The short, laterally flattened tail tapers rapidly to a blunt scale at the end. The dorsal scales, all smooth, are disposed in 21 rows immediately behind the head, in 19 rows on the anterior portion of the trunk, increase in number to 21 at midbody, and diminish to 15 at the base of the tail. In the following dorsal scale formula the figures in parentheses are the lateral rows indicated by number, and the paravertebral rows by P, followed by the ventral count where the change occurs: [scale formula here] There are 166 ventrals, followed by an undivided anal and 24 undivided subcaudals, not counting the blunt scale on the end of the tail. The rostral is appreciably wider than high (2.9 mm. in width, 1.7 mm. in height) and visible from above, where the median portion of it reaches a broad, undivided internasal, the largest scale on the head. Behind the internasal there are two large prefrontals in broad contact with the frontal, and the anterior end of the supraocular. The frontal, with a blunt apex behind the suture of the paired prefrontals, is flanked laterally by supraoculars, followed by vestiges of the parietals. The scalelike parietals extend to a median scale behind the tapered end of the frontal (fig. 3). On each side of the head the rostral is in broad contact with the first supralabial and the nasal on each side. The nostril is near the middle of an undivided nasal situated above the first supralabial and bordered posteriorly by the loreal, which lies below the suture between the internasal and the prefrontal. The preocular is approximately the size and shape of the rectangular loreal in front of it, but slightly smaller than the nasal. The distance between the eye and the border of the mouth is less than the diameter of the eye. The pupil is vertical and semi-elliptical, rounded above but pointed below. Two postoculars are followed by two scales between the supralabials and the vestiges of the parietal. There are seven supralabials, the first and second of which reach the loreal on the left, but on the right, a small portion of the third supra-labial reaches the loreal. The third and fourth supralabials reach the eye; the third supralabial is largest. The lower margin of the mouth is bordered by seven infralabials on each side. The anteriormost infralabials, which are much larger than the others, meet on a broad suture behind the blunt apex of a large mental, thus separating it from a pair of short chin-shields. These are followed by a second pair of much more slender chin-shields, which meet on the mental groove; these are longer but indistinguishable in other respects from the first of four gular scales that separate the mental groove from the first ventral. The scales in contact with the outer edges of the second pair of chin-shields are in the same row as those bordering the ventral scales posteriorly. Small pustules, present on all cephalic plates, are more numerous on the sides of the head, particularly on the lips. The dorsum is almost uniformly black, although the scales on the trunk are more heavily pigmented near the middle than at their margins. The gular scales are margined with gray, which is to some extent true of the ventrals. The only conspicuous marking, however, is an immaculate white area that covers the anal scute, the contiguous scales, as well as the margin of the penultimate ventral. Faint traces of a narrow light stripe extend through the upper portions of the supralabials from the angle of the mouth (figs. 4 and 5). (Bogert 1968)
Eryx colubrinus	Serpentes	Boidae	Description: The rostral is large and broad; 11-13 scales between the eyes; 12-15 scales around the eye; 12-14 upper labials (fig. 20); scale rows 47-53; ventrals 171-197; anal and subcaudals 19-28, entire; a large specimen total length 620 mm, tail 50 mm, TL/T = 12.4 to 13.2. Short tail terminating with a conical scale. The colour is yellowish or greyish with large irregular blackish or brownish spots separated by narrow interspaces. The lower parts immaculate yellowish.” (Gasperetti 1988)
Eryx conicus	Serpentes	Boidae	Description: Rostral about twice as broad as high, just visible from above, without angular horizontal edge ; nostril slit-like, between the two nasals and the internasais only these scales enlarged, the rest of the head being covered with small, obtusely keeled scales, 8 to 10 scales across the forehead between the eyes ; 10 to 15 scales round the eye sometimes two series of scales separating the eye from the labial, which are from 12 to 14 in number no mental groove. Scales in 40 to 55 rows, more or less strongly, sometimes tubercularly, keeled, very strongly upon the tail: V. 162-196; C. 16-24. Tail pointed. The hemipenis is not forked but the sulcus bifurcates near the tip of the organ it is strongly flounced, the folds being arranged in oblique series distally they are joined together and form large cups. (Smith 1943)Coloration: Yellowish, brownish or greyish above, with a dorsal series of large, dark brown, black-edged spots, usually confluent with one another to form a zigzag stripe lower parts yellowish or whitish, the outer scale-rows with small brown spots. (Smith 1943)
Ungaliophis continentalis	Serpentes	Boidae	Definition (genus). “(Modified from Bogert, 1968a) Relatively small tropidopheids (760 mm TL.) with the head distinct from neck, relatively slender and compressed body and a short, prehensile tail (8.5-12.4% of TL). Males have well-developed anal spurs; these may be present, although not as well developed, in some females. The eye is moderate in size (its diameter is greater than its distance to the lip) with a vertically elliptical pupil. The anterior dorsal cephalic scales are relatively large, especially the frontal and the single prefrontal. The parietals are practically indistinguishable from the dorsals. There are two nasals (with nostril in anterior nasal), one loreal and one preocular, and 2-3 postoculars. Supralabials number 8-10 (two or three reaching the eye), and infralabials 9-11, the first pair of the latter in broad contact behind the moderately large mental, followed posteriorly by 2-3 pairs of chin shields. Tubercles are present on all cephalic scales. The dorsal scales are smooth (except for minute tubercles), in 19-25 rows at midbody, reducing to 17 or 15 near the vent. Ventral scales range from 204 to 258. Subcaudals are single, numbering 39-46. The anal plate is also single, and the tail ends in a blunt spine. The premaxilla is toothless and has an ascending process. The maxillae have 12-15 teeth, the first 4-5 larger and separated from the posterior ones by a short a diastema, all decreasing in size posteriorly. The palatine has 5-8, the pterygoid 11-15, and the dentary 13-15 teeth. The hemipenes are relatively long and bilobed. The sulcus spermaticus appears to bifurcate near the base, and each branch of the sulcus extends to the terminus of the lobe. The basal portion is plicate and calyces on the lobes lack crenate edges.” (Villa & Wilson 1990) Diagnosis (genus). “These small, slender-bodied boas differ from all other Tropidopheidae by having a relatively enormous, azygous prefrontal, and 19-25 rows of dorsal scales at midbody.” (Villa & Wilson 1990)Diagnosis (continentalis). A species of Ungaliophis with 25 rows of scales at midbody, reducing to 15at the vent. Color is grayish brown with dark oval vertebral and paravertebral blotches. The venter is heavily stippled with black. The rostral is in broad contact with the prefrontal, separating the small internasals. The prefrontal and frontal are subequal in size, or the prefrontal somewhat larger. Supraoculars are small, less than half the area of the frontal.There are 9-10 supralabials, two entering the orbit; 2 postoculars; and 14 maxillary teeth. (Villa & Wilson 1990)Alternative description: McCranie 2011: 72
Ungaliophis panamensis	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis: A species of Ungaliophis with 19-23 (rarely 25) rows of scales at midbody, reducing to 17 at the vent. Color is brown with dark diamond- or hourglass-shaped vertebral and triangular paravertebral blotches. The venter is heavily pigmented with prominent ovoid blotches running across the ventrals at least on the posterior half of the body. The rostral is separated from the prefrontal by the internasals. The prefrontal is considerably larger than the frontal. Supraoculars are relatively large, larger than half the area of the frontal. There are 7-9 supralabials, two or three entering the orbit, and 2-3 postoculars. There are 13-15 maxillary teeth. (Villa & Wilson 1990)
Eunectes beniensis	Serpentes	Boidae	Identification. The meristic data and description from accounts by Dirksen (2002) and Dirksen and Böhme (2005) for E. beniensis are augmented with additional information based on our examination of the newly collected specimens. Eunectes beniensis is characterized by having 36–39/48–51/30–33 dorsal scales (unkeeled, with no apical pits), 219–230 narrow ventral scales, 54–59 subcaudal scales, undivided cloacal scale, one loreal scale, one preocular scale, three postocular scales, two or three subocular scales in contact with supralabials (Fig. 2), 14 or 15 supralabial scales, 17–19 infralabial scales, temporal scales numerous and variable, and chin-shields not present. See Table 1 for comparison of meristic data of new specimens. (Powell et al. 2023)Color, pattern, and description: stout-bodied with head large and slightly differentiated from neck. Dorsum ground color olive-brown with 87–126 large, dorsal, black blotches, separated by three or four scales with smaller, solid, roundish or irregularly shaped, black blotches throughout flank region. Head color same as dorsum, with five distinct, black, longitudinal stripes, two or three scales wide (Fig. 3), one median dorsal, one pair of dorsolateral, and one pair of lateral stripes; lateral stripe starting from posterior eye to slightly past mouth. Eyes medium-sized, slightly dorsal, with elliptical pupil and brown to bronze iris. Ventral color yellow, with numerous black irregular marks throughout and sometimes forming interrupted longitudinal shapes. (Powell et al. 2023)
Eryx borrii	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis: The new species is morphologically close to E. somalicus fromwhich it is distinguished by a more slender habitus (ratio total length/maximumtransverse diameter about 39.35, versus 24.03-30.00 in E. somalicus); a larger number of ventral scales (193 instead of no more than 163 in E. somalicus); smaller size of the scales between the anterior level of eyes and postnasal (their minimum number along the middle region of the snout 3, versus 13⁄4 in E. somalicus). The dorsal pattern shows longitudinal or more or less oblique off-white fragmented stripes that are transverse to more or less oblique in E. somalicus.
Epicrates maurus	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis: Distinguished from all continental species of Epicrates by having: (1) lateral stripe of the body with four scales width, (2) irregular lateral ocelli in juvenile and indistinct in adults specimens, (3) dorsal ground color yellow to light brown in juveniles and uniform brown in adults, with noticeable ontogenetic change of coloration. Additionally, E. maurus differ from E. cenchria, E. assisi, and E. alvarezi by having hemipenis length (in situ). 13 subcaudal scales long; from E. cenchria and E. alvarezi, by having barely conspicuous parietal crest and reduced alary process of vomer; from E. cenchria, by having ventral scales, 245; from E. crassus, by having subcaudal scales generally . 50. Refer to Tables 6–7 for additional diagnostic features of the continental Epicrates.
Corallus batesii	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis: Distinguishable from all other species of Corallus (except C. caninus) based on its green dorsal ground color (rarely black or nearly so) with enamel-white markings on the dorsum (never immaculate green). Juveniles are usuallyred-orange with enamel-white markings (other species of Corallus are various shades of gray, brown, red, and yellow as adults, always with patterns consisting of more than just white markings). Differs from C. caninus by the number of scales across snout at level of suture between the third and fourth supralabials (3–12, mean = 6.9 +/- 1.6 in C. batesii; 2– 6, mean = 3.4 +/- 1.1 in C. caninus), presence or absence of mid-dorsal longitudinal stripe (absent in C. caninus), and lateral blotches rarely absent (0–38, mean = 18.1 +/- 8.2 in C. batesii; 0–11, mean = 1.3 +/- 2.7 in C. caninus). Mitochondrial DNA sequence differences between Amazonia samples (C. batesii) and those from the Guiana Shield (C. caninus) ranged from 3.1–16.2% (Vidal et al., 2005) [from HENDERSON et al. 2009].

Differing from all others of the pau/soni subeomplex (as well as those of the carinata subcomplex) in usually having 34 or more anterior seale rows, 40 or more maximum scale rows, and 27 or more posterior seale rows; usually 13 or more supralabials, 14 or more infralabials; 3rd supralabial usually split on both sides; and usually supralabials 7-8, 7-8-9, or 8-9, entering orbit. (Smith et al. 1981: 298)Description of holotype (vindumi). A young, well preserved female with one short abdominal slit. Scale rows 34-43-28; keels present on all dorsal seales except in 1st and 2nd rows. Ventrals 187; anal entire, preeeded by apreanal as narrow as anal, narrower than adjaeent ventral; umbilicus on ventrals 145-7; subcaudals 39, the 1st divided but its halves in contact; an additional, terminal eaudal spine. Supralabials 14-14, 7th and 8th entering orbit on both sides; 14-15 infralabials; 12-13 circumorbitals, including a large preocular on each side and one small subpreocular on one side, two on the other; 3 postrostrals; 2 internasals; 2 scales between postrostrals and internasals; a minimum of 11 scales in a row between preoculars anterior to circumorbitals, 9 between orbits; 3-3 enlarged supraoculars, 2-2 entering orbit; 3 scales contacting nasal between postrostral and 2nd supralabial; 3rd and 4th supralabials split on both sides, as compared with 2nd; 3 prefrontals.

Ground colour, a light grey-brown, lighter on venter; a vertebral darker streak about four scales wide, with lateral extensions onto four or more scale rows on eaeh side, usually alternating so as to produee a somewhat zigzag pattern; under side of head mostly dark, of about same shade as top of head and the dark marks on body. Tail dark brown, almost black, sharply contrasted with body, its pattern an expansion of the dorsal pattern of body, but with equally dark blotches on lower surface separated from each other and from dorsal markings by irregular white areas. (Smith et al. 1981: 298)Variation (vindumi). See tables. Eleven females (of 26) exceeded the TTL of the largest male. Only 11 of the total of 37 examined were males. No specimens examined exhibited the striped morph that is so common in members of the carinata subcomplex, and occurs also in Candoia p. mcdowelli; all had a zigzag pattern much Iike the holotype. However, four had a very bright pattern because of a light, almost white ground colour and nearly black markings. The tail is distinctly darker than the body in all except the four brightly marked specimens, in which the body markings are about as dark as those on the tail. (Smith et al. 1981: 299)Comparisons (vindumi). Candoia p. vindumi is readily distinguished from the rest of the paulsoni subcomplex by its high number o f scale rows, as weil as bya few other characters. In 92% of C. p. vindumi the anterior scale rows are 34 or more (vs 11% in C. p. paulsoni, 0% in the other subspecies of C. paulsoni); maximum scale rows 40 or more in 100% (vs 21 % in C. p. paulsoni, 0-5% in the other subspecies); posterior scale rows 27 or more in 100% (vs 22% in C. p. paulsoni, 1-12% in the other subspecies). In addition, the supralabials are 13 or more in 96% of Candoia p. vindumi, 30% of C. p. paulsoni, and 2-13% in others of the subcomplex. Concomitantly, only the 7th and/or higher numbers of supralabials enter the orbit in 69% of C. p. vindumi, only 0-8% in the others. The 3rd supralabial is split on both sides in 81% of C. p. vindumi, in 54% of C. p. paulsoni and 0-16% of the rest. The infralabials are 14 or more in 91% of C. p. vindumi, in 48% of C. p.paulsoni, and in 4-33% of the others.

Candoia superciliosa	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis and definition (based on 62 specimens examined and less than a dozen others in the literature). A member of the Candoia carinata complex, differing from other complexes of the genus in having a broad, flat, slanted, bevel-like, overhung snout, supralabials entering orbit, subcaudals 35 or more, and ventrals less than 203. Unique among all members of the Candoia carinata complex in the combination of presence (Fig. 2) of a distinct postanal white spot (I 00%); absence of keels on the 2nd row of dorsals (100%); presence of a greatly enlarged supraocular on each side (Fig 3), with a minimum oD or fewer scales in a row between those on the two sides (100%); anterior scale rows fewer than 29 (100%); totallength not exceeding 885 mm, seldom reaching 700 mm; temperament retiring, withdrawing, not aggressive under any circumstance; and diet consisting almost excIusively of ectotherms. (Smith et al. 1981)Comparisons. Species other than those ofthe carinata complex have a more or less rounded snout, not flat and overhung, and the supralabials are separated from the orbit; in addition, in Candoia asper the subcaudals are in the tens or twenties, on a very short tail, and in C. bibronii the ventrals are 203 or more.Within the Candoia carinata complex, the distinct postanal white spot, docHe temperament, ectotherm diet and small size are shared only with populations from the South Moluccas (topotypes of C. carinata, see Böhme et al., 1998), and their relatives in Sangihe, Irian Jaya and northern Papua New Guinea, almost invariably with keels on the 2nd scale row at least on neck. In all populations, the enlarged supraoculars are smaller, usually there is a minimum of 4 or more scales in a row between them, and usually 2 or more border the orbit. The anterior scale rows number 29 or more in 94% of the material from the Solomon Islands, 100% of Bougainville material, 82%. from Papua New Guinea, and 79% from Halmahera. Totallengths of900 mm or more, up to 1375 mm, are known from Halmahera, Bougainville and the Solomon Islands, the largest from the latter area. (Smith et al. 1981)Variation. See tables. Exceedingly polymorphie in colour and pattern in life, "with everything from lemon yellow to charcoal occurring, including bright brick red, and with striped, spotted or zigzag patterns, dull to brightly contrasted" (Crombie, pers. comm.). The striped individuals have a unique, irregular dorsolateral white line on each side (Fig. 5); no other species of the carinata complex exhibits that variation in the striped phase. (Smith et al. 1981)Diagnosis (crombiei): A subspecies of Candoia superciliosa differing primarily from the nominotypical subspecies by having more than 180 ventrals (183-192, M = 188.0, n 8), vs fewer than 180 (165-178, M = 173.4, n 53).

Corallus blombergi	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis: Corallus blombergi is distinguishable from members of the C. hortulanus complex (C. cookii, C. grenadensis, C. hortulanus, C. ruschenbergerii) by the combination of presence or absence of nasal contact (usually contact in C. hortulanus complex, usually not in C. blombergi) and number of subcaudals (94–137 in C. hortulanus complex, 76–86 in C. blombergi). It is distinguishable from C. cropanii on the basis of maximum number of dorsal scale rows (<35 in C. cropanii, 50–55 in C. blombergi), and from C. caninus on the basis of maximum number of dorsal scale rows (63–77 in C. caninus), and ventrals (251–269 in C. blombergi, 186–209 in C. caninus). See the ‘Diagnosis’ for C. annulatus for comparisons with that species [HENDERSON et al. 2001].
Corallus grenadensis	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis: Corallus grenadensis is distinguished from C. hortulanus by maximum rows of dorsal scales (37–46, x = 41.0 +/- 0.12 in grenadensis vs. 47–63, x = 55.0 +/- 0.17 in hortulanus). The primary spade-like element of the dorsal pattern occasionally occurs on the mainland (primarily the Guianas and northeastern Brazil), but not on St. Vincent (C. cooki). The rhomb pattern typical of C. ruschenbergerii does not occur in C. grenadensis [from HENDERSON 1997].
Charina umbratica	Serpentes	Boidae	DEFINITION. A (sub-) species characterized by relatively low scale counts (dorsals 32-42,  x̅ ≈ 39; ventrals 182-217,  x̅ ≈ 191; sub-caudals 25-34,  x̅ ≈ 31), frontal plate usually with straight or only slightly convex posterior margin, small size (average total length under 400 mm), and light dorsal color (adults usually camel tan).(Stewart 1977)
Lichanura orcutti	Serpentes	Boidae	DIAGNOSIS. Scales in 33 to 35 rows; eye encircled by 9 or 10 scales; loreals 4; labials 13/15; gasterosteges 232 ; anal entire; urosteges 45, entire. (By loreals are here meant all the scales situated between the posterior nasals, the supralabials, the preorbitals, and the scales corresponding to the prefrontals, without reference to their origin; in the present case I think there are only two loreals proper, while the subloreal is only a detached portion of the fifth supralabials, and the supraloreal a part of the prefrontals.) (Stejneger 1889: 96)Description of type specimen. Rostral plate very prominent, recurved, pentagonal, its nasal border twice as long as its labial; eye surrounded by a ring of scales of nearly equal size, 10 on the right side, but only 9 on the left; between the posterior nasal and the middle preocular two large loreal scales, and under the posterior one, wedged in between it, the middle and lower prefrontals, and fourth, fifth, and sixth supralabials, a somewhat smaller subloreal; over the posterior loreal a superloreal of medium size; nasal divided, the anterior plate meeting the one of the other side; back of these a pair of' rather large anterior prefrontals followed by four smaller posterior prefrontals, or what corresponds to these plates where a frontal exists, the outer ones being larger than those in the middle; posterior to these the head is covered with numerous rather irregular scales; supralabials 13, the first four highest; infralabials 15, gradually diminishing in height from the pair joining the triangular mental; mental fissure separating four pairs of scales; scales of body smooth, in 33 to 35 longitudinal rows, the inferior on each side slightly larger than the rest; gasterosteges narrow. 232 ; anal small, entire ; tail short, blunt; urosteges 45, entire. (Stejneger 1889: 96)Dimensions: Total length, 870mm; length of tail from anus, 110mm; diameter of eye, 3mm; from tip of muzzle to anterior border of eye, 11mm; proportion of last two measurements=1: 3.7. (Stejneger 1889: 96)Coloration. Ground color light bluish gray, with a light brownish wash on the upper surface; three longitudinal ill defined, zigzag bands of a pale raw umber brown running the whole length of the body, the middle one starting between the eyes running to the end of the tail, the lateral ones starting on the temporal region becoming obscure on the tail; top of muzzle and occasional blotches between the bands of the same color; whole underside, except the gulars, mottled irregularly with blotches of a dark neutral tint. Of the forms which compose this genus the present species appears to be the most highly differentiated, the most distinctive feature being the elongation of the snout and the prominence and shape of the rostral. From the L. trivirgata, myriolepis, and simplex group, it differs more particularly by the low number of scale rows and loreals. In these respects it seems to agree very well with roseofusca, from which it differs in the greater number of scales composing the eye ring as well as in coloration. There may be other and more important distinctions, but not having seen a specimen of the latter species, I have to rely solely upon Professor Cope's original description, which is very meager indeed. A. specimen collected at San Diego, Cal., received from Miss Rosa Smith can not be identified with any of the other forms hitherto recognized though combining characters of some of them in such a manner as to make it probable that additional material will prove it to be only a subspecies of L. myriolepis. It may be characterized as L. simplex. (Stejneger 1889: 96)DIAGNOSIS (simplex). Scales in 40 rows; eye encircled by 7 or 8 scales; loreals 6; labials 13/15 ; gasterosteges 232; anal entire; urosteges 39, entire. (Stejneger 1889: 96)Description of type specimen (simplex). Rostral plate as in the other species, except L. orcutti, pentagonal, its nasal border but slightly longer than its labial; eye surrounded by a ring of 8 scales (on the left side, but 7 only on the right side, the two posterior superorbitals having become fused) the anteorbital being very large; three true loreals, above which two smaller supraloreals; on the right side two rather large subloreals, being the detached upper portions of the fourth and fifth supralabials, while on the left side only part of the fifth is thus separated; nasal divided, the anterior portion meeting the one of the other side; posterior to these are two pairs of rather regular prefrontals followed by the usual small irregular frontal scales of the genus; supralabials 13, the first three (four) highest; infralibials 15; mental small, triangular, mental fissure separating four pairs of scales; scales of body smooth, hexagonal, imbricated, in 40 longitudinal rows, the lower one largest; gasterosteges 232: anal small, entire; urosteges 39, entire. (Stejneger 1889: 97)Dimensions (simplex). Total length, 765mm; length of tail, from anus, 80mm : diameter of eye, 2.5mm; from tip of muzzle to anterior border of eye, 10mm ; proportion of last two measurements = 1:4. (Stejneger 1889: 98)Coloration (simplex). Uniform drab-brown above, fading into whitish on the under parts. In spite of the fewer scales forming the eye ring, a feature which seems to be of less importance, the present form appears to agree better with L. myriolepis than with roseofusca. The scale rows are only two less than in a specimen labeled L. myriolepis by Cope himself U.S. Nat. Mus., No. 14129; San Diego; Charles Orcutt, coll.), and in the numerous loreal scales it also agrees better with the latter. The diameter of the eye shows the same ratio to the distance from the tip of the muzzle in these two forms, thereby differing considerably from L. trivirgata, in which the eye is comparatively much larger. From L. or cutti the new form differs in the much less produced muzzle and rostral, in the number of scale rows, loreals, and scales composing the eye ring, in the still smaller eye, as well as in coloration. (Stejneger 1889: 98)
Sanzinia volontany	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis: Sanzinia madagascariensis volontany differs from S. m. madagascariensis by a predominantly brownish adult colouration (predominantly greenish in S. m. m.) and a high genetic differentiation in the 16S rRNA gene (Tab. 1) which is nearly twice as high as between Acrantophis madagascariensis and A. dumerilii. Morphologically, there is a tendency of the new subspecies to have a lower number of infralabials, and possibly of supralabials and perioculars (see Tab. 3), but none of these characters can be used as a reliably diagnostic difference (Vences & Glaw 2003: 194)Description of the holotype: Specimen in good state of preservation, fixed in formalin and stored in 70 % ethanol; hemipenis everted; lateral cut present; tissue sample for DNA studies removed. Total length 143 cm, counts and measurements are given in Tables 2 and 3. Head narrow, distinctly longer than wide; rostral more or less pentagonal, slightly higher than wide; one pair of internasals; anal scale undivided. The colouration in life is shown in Figures 4b and 6. The ground colour is light brown, with 32-34 dark brown markings of irregular shape on each side of the body (round, drop-like or triangular) which partly extend ventrally to contact the ventrals. In the posterior part of the body, the brown markings partly fuse in the vertebral region with each other, whereas they are generally not in contact in the anterior body part. Dorsally, the brown markings are bordered by a yellowish band which becomes broader and more distinct towards the vertebral region. In each dark marking, there is a yellowish marking of irregular shape (triangular, round or elongated). The head is dorsally brown and largely unspotted (Fig. 6) and ventrally whithish and unspotted. The ventral side of the body is whitish with numerous brownish spots which partly form irregular and interrupted dark bands. The subcaudal scales are largely brown. The colouration in preservative (after about 20 months) appears virtually identical to that in life, perhaps slightly faded. The light borders and the light markings in the brown markings have become partly whitish.(Vences & Glaw 2003: 194)Variation: Based on the data of the seven specimens as given in Table 3, S. m. volontany is characterized by the following meristic values: 203-230 ventrals; 36-46 subcaudals; 39-50 dorsals; 12-15 supralabial scales (11-13 of them with distinct vertical furrow), any supralabial between the 7th and 10th can have contact with the eye; 13-15 infralabials (12-13 of them with distinct vertical furrow); 7-13 periocular scales; 9-12 interocular scales (as defined in Tab. 3); 2-3 loreal scales. Variation in colouration and patterns is shown in Figures 5 and 7 and described in Table 4. (Vences & Glaw 2003: 194)
Chilabothrus argentum	Serpentes	Boidae	Definition. A species of Chilabothrus boid snake possessing the following characteristics: silver to tan dorsal background coloration with or without scattered dark brown scales, which appear either individually or in small clusters; a reduced to absent dorsal pattern consisting of faint light-gray elongate dorso- ventral blotching, occasionally no pattern is obvious; pure cream-white ventral scales; a single loreal scale; ventral scale count ranging from 275 to 282; subcaudal scale count ranging from 82 to 91; a low number (11–12) of supralabials; 9–10 circumorbitals; largely arboreal substrate use; phylogenetic distinctiveness at mitochondrial locus CYTB consisting of > 3% pairwise divergence from other Bahamian Chilabothrus species. (Reynolds et al. 2016)Comparisons: Chilabothrus argentum sp. nov. is similar in scale counts to C. chrysogaster, particularly to C. c. schwartzi, though C. chrysogaster generally has fewer ventrals (242–277 versus 275–282 in C. argentum) and more supralabials (12–16 versus 11–12 in C. argentum) and is quite variable in meristic characters and coloration across its range (Tolson and Henderson, 1993; Reynolds and Gerber, 2012). Chilabothrus c. relicquus is variable in coloration (Suppl. Fig. S1), and most specimens have some dorsal patterning and resemble other members of the species. Occasionally individuals of C. chrysogaster have reduced color patterns (Reynolds and Gerber, 2012), and one specimen of C. c. relicquus (KUH 260080; Suppl. Fig. S1) has a color pattern somewhat similar to C. argentum sp. nov., though this specimen has two loreals (like C. chrysogaster) and a higher number of supralabials (13 versus 11–12), preoculars (3 versus 1), and postocu- lars (5 versus 4), all similar to C. chrysogaster. (Reynolds et al. 2016)
Boa imperator	Serpentes	Boidae	Description: “Snout scarcely prominent. Rostral as broad as deep, not visible from above ; symphysial at least as long as broad head-scales small, sometimes slightly enlarged on the snout an enlarged loreal sometimes present, in front of the prœoculars, one of which is more or less enlarged 15 to 18 scales across the forehead, from eye to eye; 14 to 20 scales round the eye, which is separated from the labials by one or two series of scales 18 to 21 upper labials. Scales in 61 to 79 rows. Ventral 225-252; anal entire; subcaudals 47-65. Coloration as in B. constrictor, but no red on the tail, and dorsal cross bars more numerous, viz. 22 to 30 on the body ; the dark line on the middle of the head usually with a process on each side between the eye, thus forming a cross.Total length 2800 millim.; tail 280.Mexico to Western South America (Colombia to Peru).” (Boulenger 1893: 119)Scale counts (13 specimens): Boulenger 1893: 119
Boa nebulosa	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis: A Constrictor with a prominent snout and a strikingly convex canthus; 59 to 69 dorsal scale rows at midbody, 258 to 273 ventrals, and 32 to 35 very obscure, irregular transverse markings to the level of the anus; dorsal ground color very dark, clouded, grey-brown; venter ash to slate grey, blotched and mottled with black; both loreal and subocular stripes absent, or, at most, partially indicated and largely obsolete; infralabials and chin merely grey [Lazell 1964]
Boa orophias	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis: A Constrictor with a prominent snout and a convex canthus; 65 to 75 dorsal scale rows at midbody, 270 to 288 ventrals, and 27 to 31 distinct, subrectangular, dark dorsal saddles to the level of the anus; dorsal ground color rich brown; venter white with black or grey spotting pronounced; subocular stripe distinct and complete; loreal stripe largely obsolete; dark pigment on chin and infralabials not closely corresponding to the facial stripes [Lazell 1964: 261].
Eryx sistanensis	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis: Eryx sistanensis sp. nov. and E. johnii differ from other erycids by having the banding pattern on the tail, although this pattern is not always observed in the specimens of E. johnii (Boulenger 1893; Wall 1912; Smith 1943; Minton 1966; Leviton & Anderson 1970; Sorensen 1988; Das 1991; Sharma 2007). As Russell (1801) stated in the description of the type specimen of E. johnii: “the obtuse point of the tail resembles the head, and in point of thickness sometimes exceeds it.” In our specimens of the new species, the end of the tail is not as blunt as E. johnii and the thickness of the end of the tail is less than that of the head (Fig. 2). Despite the overlapping ranges in the pholidosis and morphometric characters of E. sistanensis sp. nov. and E. johnii, E. sistanensis sp. nov. differs from E. johnii by having fewer dorsal scale rows at midbody (43–56 versus 47–67). (ESKANDARZADEH et al. 2020)Description of holotype (Fig. 3): A juvenile, body length 220 mm, and tail length 30 mm. The ratio of inter-ocular space width to distance between the posterior edge of the eye and the corner of the mouth 1.2. Head small, indistinct from the neck; eye small, on side of the head, bordered by 11 and 10 small scales on each side; six large scales between the eyes. Two elongated postinternasal scales; the first four rows of the scales immediately after the rostral arranged in a symmetric pattern. Three scales between the eye and nasal. Eleven supralabial scales; the second supralabial scale higher than the third. Dorsal surface of the body with small scales (DRS 43:43:38). Ventral scales 190, wider than dorsal scales. Subcaudal scales 26. The scales of the dorsal surface of tail slightly keeled. (ESKANDARZADEH et al. 2020)Coloration of holotype: The preserved specimen in alcohol has paler color than that in alive specimen. Dorsal ground color of the preserved specimen in alcohol was yellow with shadows of grey color. The banding pattern was obvious on the tail with three large dark spots; a very pale shadow of patched areas was observed over the dorsal surface of the trunk. The ventral surface was yellow. (ESKANDARZADEH et al. 2020)Variation in color: Pictures of two additional specimens from Rikukash in Sistan & Baluchistan Province (25.88N 61.68E) and near Shamil Village (27.5N 56.85E) in Hormozgan Province (Fig. 6) were also observed. These specimens had been photographed in farms by local people. In spite of the common banding pattern observed in all the studied and photographed specimens, they show different color patterns. HCHSU 8487 was grey in dorsal surface; the banding pattern along the body was more obvious than that in the holotype specimen. The head was black; ventral surface was cream with some black spots forming a narrow line in the middle of ventral surface; this line was discontinuous. The dorsal color of the specimens from Gurband was reddish brown; having large black patches on the dorsal surface; from tail to the head the patches were faint and irregular. Head with black shadow. The color pattern of the specimen from Shamil was similar to that from Gurband. The specimen from Rikukash has darker background color and the banding pattern is less obvious and less regular than the other specimens. (ESKANDARZADEH et al. 2020)
Chilabothrus ampelophis	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis: A small (maximum SVL = 697 mm) species of Chilabothrus (Figs. 2, 3) of slender habitus, with a distinctive neck, a dorsally flattened head and narrow snout, and eyes protruding dorsally above head level and directed anterolaterally. There is a distinctive head scutellation with either supraocular, frontal, and parietal (or altogether) scales highly fragmented into numerous small scales (Fig. 5); a moderate to high ventral scale count, a high modal loreal scale count, high modal circumorbital count, and high modal labial counts. The dorsal ground coloration is of dark taupe to tan-brown with a dorsal pattern of dark brown to blackish helix (zigzag) composed of fused narrow diagonal blotches, also with squarish, nearly rectangular or X-shaped blotches running dorsally, with all markings irregularly outlined and bordered with pale cream or whitish cream scales that form highly contrasting stripes or spots. There is a dark brown lateral stripe (at times disrupted) that branches toward dorsolateral and lateroventral areas, forming a diffuse reticulated effect laterally.The new species somewhat resembles C. fordii, to which it is most closely related (Figs. 5–7) and to which a closer comparison is warranted. Chilabothrus ampelophis sp. nov. differs from C. fordii (Tables 1, 2) in having a higher number of ventral scales (263–273 vs. 231–263 in C. fordii), higher count of subcaudals (86–93 vs. 69–89 in C. fordii), and higher count of dorsal scale rows at midbody (38–40 vs. 31–39 in C. fordii). Other characters (clearly separable) are: multiple supraoculars (4/4–8/8 vs. a single platelike supraocular in C. fordii; Fig. 6), as well as multiscale intersupraoculars or short frontal (vs. a single and long, platelike frontal in C. fordii) that when single, the frontal covers less than the length of an eye (vs. frontal plate longer than or as long as the eyes in C. fordii), with frontal scale variation reflecting on a highly variable head-scale formula (to 4-4-4 in C. ampelophis, but modally 3-1-3 in C. fordii; Fig. 5). Small, multiple scales are in the first row of prefrontals (vs. large prefrontals basically arranged in three pairs in C. fordii), and very small scales are in the parietal region (vs. larger, at times platelike frontoparietals in C. fordii). There are high modal counts in: supralabials 15 (vs. 13 in C. fordii), infralabials 16 (vs. 14 in C. fordii), loreals 5 (vs. 2 in C. fordii), circumorbitals 16 (vs. 10 in C. fordii), infraloreals 2–4, mode 2 (vs. 0–2, mode 1 in C. fordii), and preoculars 2 (vs. 1 in C. fordii).The new species also differs in having a more distinctive neck (% NW/HW 50–53, x̅= 51 vs. 57–62, x̅ = 59 in C. fordii), a flatter head and snout (vs. convex frontal region and a tapered snout in C. fordii; Fig. 6), with orbits and supraoculars protruding over the level of the frontal region in profile view (vs. supraoculars below or not protruding over the frontal region in C. fordii; Fig. 6), a more attenuate snout (% IN/IO 42–46, x̅ = 45 vs. 49–63, x̅ = 53 in C. fordii), a slightly longer snout (% RO/HL 35–36, x̅ = 35 vs. 31–36, x̅ = 34 in C. fordii), and a wider interocular distance (% of IO/HL 31–35, x̅ = 33 vs. 25– 33, x̅ = 30 in C. fordii). Chilabothrus fordii has a maximum known SVL of 860 mm (Tolson and Henderson 1993), whereas the largest C. ampelophis sp. nov. we observed was 697 mm SVL. Lengths of the TAIL/SVL are moderately higher (22–25, x̅ = 24 vs. 20– 23, x̅ = 22 in C. fordii). The dorsal coloration (in life) of C. ampelophis sp. nov. differs in having a darker ground color (dark taupe to tan-brown vs. pale gray to ‘‘grayish tan’’ in C. fordii) and in the shape of the primary elements of the dorsal pattern of dark brown to blackish narrow blotches (one to three scales wide at mid-dorsum) diagonally arranged and fused to form a zigzag (Fig. 7); some of the blotches consist of irregularly outlined bold Xs, squares, or rectangles, lined with pale cream scales (vs. pale milk-chocolate brown to medium brown ovate or subcircular blotches three to four scales wide and usually transverse, isolated, and lined with pale gray scales, but see Discussion); venter is pale cream to light gray sprinkled with darker gray and brown (vs. white or dirty white with gray suffusions in C. fordii); in preservative, the new species is nearly monochromatic with only ventral pale cream suffusions (vs. brown dorsal pattern and a light beige venter in C. fordii); these two species have an allopatric distribution (Fig. 1; see Discussion).Chilabothrus ampelophis sp. nov. differs from another close relative, the also slender and small (maximum SVL to 900 mm) C. gracilis, by the orbits and supraoculars protruding above the frontal region (vs. orbits and supraoculars not protruding above the frontal region in C. gracilis); also by the longer head (% HL/SVL 3.0–4.0, x̅ = 3.4 vs. 2.4–2.7, x̅ = 2.5 in C. gracilis), longer snout (% NO/HL 27–28, x̅ = 27 vs. 23–25, x̅ = 24 in C. gracilis), much more attenuated snout (% IN/HL 14–15, x̅ = 15, IN/HW 26– 29, x̅ = 28, and IN/IO 42–46, x̅ = 45 vs. 18– 21,x̅ =19,31–36,x̅ =33,and49–55,x̅ =53, respectively), narrower neck (% NW/HW 50–53, x̅ =51 vs. 38–51, x̅ =44 in C. gracilis), and smaller eye (% OL/HL 15–18, x̅ = 17 vs. 18–21, x̅ = 20). There are also multiscale intersupraoculars or short frontal (vs. a single and long platelike frontal in C. gracilis), a lower count of ventrals (263–273 vs. 271–304 in C. gracilis), and lower count of subcaudals (86–93 vs. 90–111 in C. gracilis). It is further differentiated by the shape of the primary elements of dorsal pattern (dark brown to black zigzag, X-shaped, squarish, and rectangular blotches vs. ovate to subcircular dark brown body blotches); their distributions are allopatric (see Discussion).From sympatric C. striatus, C. ampelophis sp. nov. differs in having a diminutive body size (maximum known SVL 697 mm vs. maximum SVL . 1,900 mm; Reynolds et al., 2016b), orbits and supraoculars protruding above the frontal region (vs. orbits and supraoculars not protruding above the frontal region in C. striatus), fewer ventrals (263– 273 vs. 266–299 in C. striatus), fewer dorsal scale rows at midbody (38–40, modally 38 vs. 35–65, modally 48 or more in C. striatus), infralabials modally 16 (vs. 18 or 19 in C. striatus), loreals modally 5 (vs. 1 or 2 in C. striatus). The shape of the primary elements of the dorsal pattern also differs (dark brown to black zigzag, and X-shaped, squarish, or rectangular blotches vs. 60–122 stripes or elongated blotches, often virtually patternless in C. striatus).
Boa sigma	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis (sigma): “Like Constrictor constrictor imperator, but ventrals more numerous, 258-259 as compared with the range of 225-253 in mainland specimens” (Smith 1943: 411).
