Abronia anzuetoi differs from all other species of Abronia, except A. aurita, A. graminea, and A. smithi, in having a distinctly yellow circumorbital region. Abronia anzuetoi differs from A. aurita in coloration (dark emerald green or dark blue green versus a paler green with yellow and/or orange markings), in having relatively longer posterior internasals, and possibly in being of a larger body size (maximum known SVL 135 mm versus 125 mm). Abronia anzuetoi differs from A. gaiophantasma in having more numerous postoccipital rows between the occipital and first nuchal row (two or three versus one), expansion of the posterior infralabial, and in a green coloration with yellow eye region (versus a brown dorsum and circumorbital region not yellow), and from A. lythrochila in having a divided postmental (usually single in A. lythrochila), and in a green dorsal coloration with yellow orbit (color variable in A. lythrochila, but often brownish or with numerous black markings, never with yellow orbit).” (Campbell & Frost 1993: 23)

Abronia aurita differs from all other species of Abronia except A. graminea, A. anzuetoi, and A. smithi (fig. 11E) in having a distinctly yellow orbital region. Abronia aurita differs from A. anzuetoi in coloration (relatively pale green or yellow-green with yellow and/or orange markings versus dark emerald green or dark blue green), in having comparatively shorter posterior internasals, and being of a smaller size (maximum SVL 125 versus 135 mm). Abronia aurita differs from A. gaiophantasma in having more numerous postoccipital rows between the occipital and first nuchal row (two or three versus one), having multiple rows of nonimbricate preauriculars (versus two or fewer subimbricate rows), having an expanded posterior infralabial, the parietal usually in contact with the median supraoculars (not so in A. gaiophantasma), and features of color pattern. Abronia aurita differs from most specimens of A. lythrochila in having discrete canthals (versus canthals usually fused with posterior internasals) and in having a distinctly yellow circumorbital region.” (Campbell & Frost 1993: 13 and Table 1).
Abronia deppii	Sauria	Anguidae	Diagnosis (genus): Abronia can be distinguished from all other gerrhonotines(Coloptychon, Gerrhonotus, Barisia, Elgaria, and Mesaspis) in the combination of having: (1) the fifth row of temporal scales absent (except, probably anomalously,on one side of one specimen of A. salvadorensis) (present in all other genera); (2)large, well-clawed limbs (smaller limbs in all other genera); and (3) a reduced lateral fold (much better developed in all other genera),particularly between the anterior limb and ear (Campbell & Frost 1993: 98).Diagnosis: This species has (1) the supraauricular scales weakly developed knob-like, having no indication of spines; (2) supranasals not expanded and not in contact at dorsal midline; (3) frontonasal usually in contact with frontal; (4) posterior internasals almost twice as long as anterior internasals (1.8); (5) no canthals;(6) three anterior temporals in each side; (7) parietal separated from supraoculars; (8) single occipital; (9) posterior head scales weakly developed knob-like; (10) anterior supercilliary not contacting the cantholoreal; (11) posterior suboccular separated from the lower primary temporal by the penultimate scale in the supralabial series; (12) preauricular scales slightly enlarged and in one row;(13) two postmentals; (14) posterior infralabials elongated; (15) preauricular scales slightly enlarged; (16) six longitudinal nuchal scale rows; (17) 24-28 transversal dorsal scale rows; (18) 10-12 longitudinal dorsal scale rows; (19) 12-14 longitudinal ventral scale rows; (20) six, sometimes seven, dark dorsal bands.Abronia deppii can be distinguished from the Guerrero population by weakly developed knob-like posterior head scales (Fig. 2); lower anterior temporal in broad contact with antepenultimate supralabial; azygous scale between interparietal and occipital frequently present (about 60% of cases); head width <22 mm in adult males and <18 in adult females; ratio of head width to head length <0.75 in adult males; scale whorls on tail 68-80 (x = 77); infralabial scales 7-8; preauricular scales only slightly enlarged; longitudinal dorsal scale rows 10-11; dorsum with well defined bold black crossbands, confluent and more or less symmetrical on vertebral region; dorsal head coloration with pattern of black and white irregular blotches; ventral color in adult males tends to be reddish, occasionally bright red; upper lips marked with black. Differs from other species of the subgenus Abronia (sensu Campbell and Frost, 1993) by having oblique longitudinal rows of dorsal scales, where fuscolabialis, taeniata, and graminea have parallel longitudinal scale rows,where taeniata and graminea do not; has one lowertemporal contacting postoccular series; and a single occipital, where mixteca and oaxacae have three occipitals and two primary temporals contacting postocular series; has body coloration that it is not uniformly green, where graminea is; has six nuchals, where graminea has four (only juveniles of graminea have bands on the dorsum of the body).

Abronia fimbriata	Sauria	Anguidae	Diagnosis: “One of the most distinctive species of Abronia, having: (1) distinctive spinelike supra-auricular scales in subadults and adults; (2) expanded supranasals meeting at midline; (3) frontonasal absent; (4) posterior internasals relatively large through fusion with canthals; (5) no discrete canthals, these apparently fused with posterior internasals; (6) two or three (most frequently two [anomalous fourth on one side of the lectotype]) primary temporals, the lower two contacting postoculars; (7) parietals usually in contact with the median supraoculars; (8) a single occipital; (9) posterolateral head scales not knoblike; (10) anterior superciliary contacting cantholoreal, similar in length to other scales in series; (11) posterior subocular in contact with the lower primary temporal or narrowly separated by the penultimate supralabial, which is the posteriormost scale in this series to reach the orbit; (12) preauricular scales small but not protuberant, disposed in 2-3 rows; (13) postmental single; (14) posterior infralabial not elongate; (15) six longitudinal nuchal scale rows; (16) 27-30 dorsal transverse scale rows; (17) 14 dorsal longitudinal scale rows arranged parallel to ventrolateral fold; (18) usually 12 (infrequently 14) ventral longitudinal scale rows, lateral row expanded; (19) mature adult dorsal coloration brown with much black mottling (fine vermiculation) concentrated dorsally (fig. 10D); (20) juvenile pattern of a broad pale brown middorsal stripe; subadults and young adults with brown chevron-shaped crossbands (figs. 10E, F). Abronia fimbriata consistently lacks the median frontonasal scale (figs. 6, 52); the only other species to do so (variably) are A. oaxacae (fig. 12F), in which a frontonasal is present in more than half of the known individuals, A. taeniata, in which a frontonasal is rarely absent, A. lythrochila (fig. 11F), in which one of eight specimens that we have examined lacks a frontonasal, and IBUNAM 340, which was previous identified as Gerrhonotus fimbriatus by Martín del Campo (1939) and as Abronia ochoterenai by Hartweg and Tihen (1946), Then (1954), and Casas-Andreu and Smith (*1990" [1991]). We have re-examined this specimen (IBUNAM 340) and find it to represent an undescribed species (see A. leurolepis account, following). The body of A. fimbriata (fig. 10D) is relatively elongate compared with A. aurita (fig. 10A), A. anzuetoi (fig. 11C), A. ochoterenai (fig. 14), A. leurolepis (fig. 17), and A. lythrochila (fig. 11F). This species differs from all other Abronia having spinelike supra-auricular scales, except for A. smithi, A. ochoterenai, A. leurolepis, and some A. matudai, in usually having 12 longitudinal ventral scale rows, with the lateral rows expanded. Abronia fimbriata is distinctive from these species in lacking both a frontonasal and discrete canthal scales. Other than A. fimbriata, only A. ornelasi and A. reidi exhibit large expanded supranasals that meet at the midline. In some specimens of A. matudai, the only known specimen of A. mitchelli, and one example of A. salvadorensis, the supranasals are expanded part way across the dorsum of the snout, but do not meet at the midline. All of these species lack spinelike supra-auricular scales. (Campbell & Frost 1993: 16)VARIATION: Campbell & Frost 1993: 18
Abronia gaiophantasma	Sauria	Anguidae	Diagnosis: “A species of Abronia having: (1) supra-auricular scales of subadults and adults spinelike; (2) supranasals relatively small and unexpanded, not in contact at the dorsal midline; (3) frontonasal scale present, not contacting frontal; (4) posterior internasals relatively small, only slightly larger than the anterior internasals; (5) canthals discrete; (6) three or four anterior temporals per side, usually the lower two (rarely one) contacting the postoculars; (7) parietal not in contact with median supraoculars; (8) usually a single occipital; (9) posterolateral head scales not knoblike; (10) anterior superciliary contacting cantholoreal, similar in length to other scales in series; (11) posterior subocular broadly separated from the lower primary temporal by the penultimate supralabial, the posteriormost scale in this series to reach the orbit; (12) two or occasionally three incomplete rows of subimbricate preauricular scales; (13) postmental single or divided; (14) posteriormost infralabial not elongate; (15) six longitudinal nuchal scale rows; (16) 28-30 dorsal transverse scale rows; (17) 12 dorsal longitudinal scale rows, arranged parallel to ventrolateral fold; (18) 14-16 ventral longitudinal scale rows; (19) adults tan, brown, gray-brown, or reddish brown (fig. 11A); (20) juveniles and subadults with dark brown crossbands (fig. 11 B). This species differs from other species of Abronia occurring east of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in having 12 (versus 14 or more) dorsal longitudinal scale rows. Abronia gaiophantasma (fig. 11A, B) differs from all Nuclear Central American species, except A. salvadorensis, A. matudai females, and some individuals of A. lythrochila in having an essentially brown dorsal coloration, with or without dark crossbands. Abronia gaiophantasma differs from A. salvadorensis in lacking a fourth row of temporal scales, having distinct supra-auricular spines; from A. matudai in having unexpanded supranasals, in usually having 3-4 anterior temporals (versus usually 2), in having 14-16 ventral longitudinal scale rows (versus 12), iN having distinct supraauricular spinelike scales, and in lacking contact between the parietals and the median supraoculars; and from A. lythrochila in having smaller lateral neck scales, having larger scales in the temporal region, lacking multiple rows of granular preauriculars, and lacking red pigment on the upper edge of the infralabials.” (Campbell & Frost 1993: 20)VARIATION: Campbell & Frost 1993: 21
Abronia leurolepis	Sauria	Anguidae	Diagnosis: “A species of Abronia having: (1) distinctive spinelike supra-auricular scales in adults; (2) unexpanded supranasals; (3) no median frontonasal scale; (4) posterior internasals not greatly enlarged, in the only known specimen the one on the right fused with the canthal; (5) canthals meeting at the midline, the left discrete, the right fused with the posterior internasal; (6) three primary temporals, the lower two contacting the postoculars; (7) narrow parietal-median supraocular contact on one side in the only known specimen; (8) a single large occipital; (9) posterolateral head scales not knoblike; (10) anterior superciliary contacting cantholoreal; (11) posterior subocular broadly separated from the lower primary temporal by the antepenultimate supralabial, the posteriormost scale in this series to reach the orbit; (12) preauricular scales small, nonimbricate and in three rows; (13) postmental single; (14) posteriormost infralabial elongate; (15) six longitudinal nuchal scale rows; (16) 31 dorsal transverse scale rows; (17) 14 dorsal longitudinal scale rows arranged parallel to ventrolateral fold; (18) 12 ventral longitudinal scale rows; (19) adult dorsal ground coloration unknown, but with dorsal crossbands; and (20) juvenile color pattern unknown. This species differs from all other species of Abronia having spinelike supra-auricular scales, except for A. smithi, A. ochoterenai, and A. fimbriata (variably), in having 12 longitudinal ventral scale rows, with the lateral rows expanded compared with adjacent ventral rows. Abronia leurolepis differs from all members of the Abronia aurita group except A. fimbriata and A. lythrochila (variably) in lacking a frontonasal scale. Abronia leurolepis differs from A. fimbriata in lacking expanded supranasals that meet at the dorsal midline, in having more dorsal transverse scale rows (31 versus 27-30), and in being a stockier animal. Abronia leurolepis differs from A. lythrochila in lacking a frontonasal (usually present in A. lythrochila), in having a single a scale row between the occipital and first nuchal scale row, in having 12 versus 14 ventral longitudinal scale rows, and in having more (31 versus 28-30) dorsal transverse scale rows. Abronia leurolepis differs from A. ochoterenai in having a single (rather than two) postoccipital row between the occipital and first transverse nuchal scale row and in having no contact between the subocular and lower primary temporal (broad contact in A. ochoterenai). Abronia leurolepis differs from all members of the A. aurita group in having almost flat dorsal scales, with only slight traces of keeling on 3-4 scale rows on either side of the midline. The lateral longitudinal row of ventral scales are expanded in this species as they are in all members of the A. aurita group having 12 ventral longitudinal scale rows. However, the posterior (free) edges of the expanded scales in A. leurolepis are obtusely pointed, whereas in other species of the A. aurita group having 12 ventral longitudinal rows the posterior edges of these scales are rounded to truncate. The occipital scale is large in A. leurolepis as are the scales immediately behind it; thus, only a single scale lies between the occipital and first transverse nuchal scale row, a character shared in the A. aurita group only with A. gaiophantasma.” (Campbell & Frost 1993: 35)
Abronia matudai	Sauria	Anguidae	Diagnosis: “A species of Abronia having: (1) supra-auricular scales of adults and subadults protuberant, but not spinelike; (2) supranasals large and often expanded, extending partially across the top of the snout, but not contacting each other at the dorsal midline; (3) a relatively large frontonasal scale, not contacting frontal; (4) posterior internasals relatively small, nearly the same size as the anterior internasals (except on one side of the holotype); (5) discrete canthals; (6) usually two anterior temporals per side, occasionally three or four; (7) parietal contacting median supraoculars; (8) a single occipital scale; (9) posterolateral head scales not knoblike; (10) anterior superciliary contacting cantholoreal, longer than other scales in series; (11) the posterior subocular separated from the lower primary temporal by the antepenultimate or occasionally the penultimate supralabial, the posteriormost scale in this series to reach the orbit; (12) two rows of subimbricate to granular preauricular scales; (13) postmental single or divided; (14) posteriormost infralabial not elongate; (15) six longitudinal nuchal scale rows; (16) 33-37 dorsal transverse scale rows; (17) 14-16 dorsal longitudinal scale rows, arranged parallel to ventrolateral fold; (18) 12-14 ventral longitudinal scale rows; (19) adult males green, females brown; (20) juvenile pattern unknown. This species differs from all species of Abronia east of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, except A. ornelasi, A. bogerti, A. montecristoi, and A. salvadorensis, in lacking distinctive spinelike supra-auriculars, although adults have relatively short but protuberant supraauricular scales. Abronia matudai differs from all Nuclear Central American species, except A. fimbriata, A. bogerti, and some individuals of A. aurita, in having the parietal contact the median supraoculars. Abronia matudai differs from A. ornelasi in having supranasals that do not contact each other at the dorsal midline and in having a frontonasal that does not contact the frontal; from A. montecristoi and A. salvadorensis in having more (33-37 versus 28 and 31-32 respectively) dorsal transverse scale rows; from A. fimbriata in having supranasals that do not meet at the dorsal midline and in having a frontonasal; from A. bogerti in usually having a minimum of six (versus eight) nuchals across the nape and 33-37 (versus 40) dorsal transverse scale rows; and from A. aurita in having more dorsal transverse scale rows (33-37 versus 27-31) and in lacking distinctive spinelike supraauricular scales.” (Campbell & Frost 1993: 38)Variation: Campbell & Frost 1993: 38
Abronia meledona	Sauria	Anguidae	Diagnosis: A species of Abronia in which (1) the distinctive supra-auricular scales of adults are protuberanat and spinelike; (2)supranasals are small and unexpanded, not in contact at dorsal midline; (3) median frontonasal scale present,usually not contacting frontal; (4) posterior internasals not greatly enlarged; (5) canthals discrete; (6) 2-3 anterior temporals per side; if two, both contacting the postoculars; if three, lower two contacting postoculars and upperscale relatively small and variably in contact with parietal; (7) parietal usually contacting median supraoculars, but in individuals having three anterior temporals per side, the upper temporal scale intervenes to partially or completely separate the parietal from the median supraocular series; (8) occipital single; (9) posterior head scales of adults not strongly convex or knoblike; (10) anterior superciliary contacting cantholoreal, similar in length to other scales in series; (11) posterior subocular broadly separated from the lower primary temporal by the penultimate supralabial, the posteriormost scale in this series to reach the orbit; (12) granular preauricular scales in about three rows; (13) postmental single; (14) posterior infralabial elongate, usually about twice as long as preceding infralabials; (15) longitudinal nuchal scales in six rows; (16) dorsal scales in 27-32 transverse rows; (17) dorsal scales in 14 (rarely 12) longitudinal scale rows, arranged parallel relative to ventrolateral fold; (18) ventral scales in 14 longitudinal rows; (19) dorsum of adults green or cream-colored with heavy black mottling (Fig. 1); (20) subadults bronze with black spots arranged in irregular transverse series across dorsum.The characters in the standard diagnosis given above will serve to distinguish this species from most other species of Abronia, exclusive of some members of the aurita subgroup. Members of this subgroup are similar to each other morphologically, but can be distinguished by their unique color patterns and by a combination of morphological features (Table 1). In contrast to the pinkish cream or green dorsal coloration that is very heavily mottled with black in A. meledona, the dorsum is paler green with less black mottling in A. aurita and A. vasconcelosii, deep emerald green with the posterior edges of the scales yellow-green in A. anzuetoi, and some shade of brown with moderate dark mottling in A. campbelli. Adult males of A. aurita and A. vasconcelosii usually have distinctive orange spots on their heads, whereas these spots are absent or poorly developed in A. meledona; if present, they are restricted to about the posterior third of individual scales in the temporal region. Orange spots are absent in A. anzuetoi and A. campbelli. The circumorbital region and supra-auricular spines are bright yellow in all species except A. campbelli, in which these areas are whitish or pale tan. Abronia vasconcelosii most frequently has 11 supralabials, whereas the other species have a modal number of 10. Some characters appear to vary somewhat clinically from east to west (exclusive of A. aurita, which occurs well to the north of the southern highlands where the other species occur). The lower tertiary temporal scale makes broad contact with the second primary temporal (thus, the lower scales of the primary and tertiary series of temporals are also in contact) with a frequency of 76% in A. campbelli, 37% in A. meledona, 50% in A. anzuetoi, 3% in A. vasconcelosii and 0% in A. aurita. The modal number of transverse dorsal and ventral scale rows, respectively, are 31 and 34 in A. campbelli, 28 and 35 for A. meledona, 28 and 36 for A. anzuetoi, and 29 and 36 for A. aurita and A. vasconcelosii.
Abronia smithi	Sauria	Anguidae	Diagnosis: “A species of Abronia having: (1) distinctive spinelike supra-auricular scales in subadults and adults; (2) unexpanded supranasals; (3) a median frontonasal scale, not contacting frontal; (4) posterior internasals not greatly enlarged; (5) discrete canthals; (6) usually four primary temporals, usually the lower two (rarely three) contacting the postoculars; (7) no parietalmedian supraocular contact; (8) a single occipital; (9) posterolateral head scales not knoblike; (10) anterior superciliary contacting cantholoreal or not; (11) the posterior subocular broadly separated from the lower primary temporal by the penultimate or antepenultimate supralabial, the posteriormost scale in this series to reach the orbit; (12) preauricular scales relatively small, usually disposed in two rows, usually imbricate or subimbricate; (13) postmental divided or single; (14) posterior infralabial not elongate; (15) six longitudinal nuchal scale rows; (16) 27-30 dorsal transverse scale rows; (17) 14 dorsal longitudinal scale rows arranged parallel to ventrolateral fold; (18) 12 ventral longitudinal scale rows; (19) adult dorsal coloration greenish (fig. 11E); (20) juvenile pattern with a broad pale brown middorsal stripe. This species differs from all other species of Abronia having spinelike supra-auricular scales, except for A. ochoterenai, A. matudai (variably), A. leurolepis, and A. fimbriata, in having 12 longitudinal ventral scale rows, and having the lateralmost rows wider than adjacent ventral rows. Abronia smithi differs from A. fimbriata and A. leurolepis in having a frontonasal scale, from A. leurolepis in having imbricate or subimbricate preauricular scales rather than multiple rows of protuberant scales, relatively short posteriormost infralabial, and definite keels on the body scales; from A. fimbriata in having unexpanded supranasals and discrete canthals; and from A. matudai in having four primary temporals (usually two, rarely three or four in A. matudai), no parietalmedian supraocular contact, and in lacking expanded supranasals. Abronia smithi appears to be most similar morphologically to A. ochoterenai, but differs from that species in having usually four or five, rather than three, primary temporals, usually having a fourth temporal scale row in evidence (clearly absent in A. ochoterenai), having the subocular separated from the lower primary temporal (broadly in contact in A. ochoterenai), usually having a divided rather than single postmental, having two or fewer rows of imbricate to subimbricate preauriculars rather than three rows of nonimbricate preauriculars, and in that adult females are yellow-green with darker spotting, rather than with dark transverse bands, and in having the circumorbital region bright yellow in A. smithi, not the ambient head color as in A. ochoterenai.” Campbell & Frost 1993: 30.Variation: Campbell & Frost 1993: 34.

Achalinus spinalis	Serpentes	Xenodermidae	Diagnosis (genus): (1) maxillary teeth 20–22, small, equal; (2) mandibular teeth equal; (3) head not or only scarcely distinct from neck; (4) eye small or moderate, with round or vertically subelliptical pupil; (5) nostril in the anterior part of a large concave nasal, divided by a vertical suture; (6) the loreal extending from the nasal to the eye; (7) body slender, cylindrical; (8) dorsal scales in 23 rows, keeled; (9) subcaudals single.Comparisons: for morphological comparisons among species of Achalinus see Li et al. 2020, Hou et al. 2021: 543 (Table 4 and key to species on page 544), Li et al. 2021 (Table 5), Zhang et al. 2023 (Table 4).
Acrochordus arafurae	Serpentes	Acrochordidae	Diagnosis (see also key to species of Acrochordus above). Differing from other species of Acrochordus in each of the following features: 1) nasal bones fused anteriorly; 2) hemipenis forked only at extreme tip, without spines or papillae; 3) pattern with intricate network of dark markings that are connected with one another but isolate spots of the brown or tawny ground colour. Additionally differing from A. javanicus (but resembling A. granulatus) in 1) absence of coronoid process on lower jaw; 2) posterior dentary teeth resembling other teeth in form; 3) scales of sides with one main cusp, flanked by much smaller cusps; 4) nasal bones tapering to a median anterior point; 5) maxillary teeth fewer (16-19); 6) dentary teeth fewer (13-17). Additionally differing from A. granulatus (but resembling A. javanicus) in: 1) nostrils directed forward, without upward inclination, separated from eye by 11-14 scales (against 5-7); 2) scales of lips less enlarged, with more rows (8-11, against 5-7) between eye and edge of lip; 3) long pterygoid row of 11-16 (against 5-7) teeth; 4) no transversely enlarged scale behind nasal; 5) less compressed tail, its vertical diametre much less than twice its horizontal diametre. (The hemipenial characters of this diagnosis checked on all males of material listed above; external, osteological, and dental characters checked on all material listed above, except nasal bones not checked for MCZ 118668, 118669, 118765, and 129121. In addition, vertebrae in region of heart checked on AMNH 86182 [Borroloola, Northern Territory] and found to have short neural spine confined to posterior edge of neural arch, essentially as in A. granulatus but unlike the high neural spine that arises from most of the length of the neural arch in A. javanicus and the Miocene-Pliocene A. dehmi Hoffstetter [1964] ). (McDowell 1979: 76)Description. Nostrils directed forward, near tip of snout, each nostril surrounded by circular nasal scute that forms a narrow rim; nasal scutes separated from each other by a granular scale at their closest approximation; nasal-eye scales 11-14 (13 bilaterally in holotype; for total of left and right, range 22-28, mean 24.5, s = 1.91, sy = 0.39, N = 24); eye-eye scales = 17-21 (holotype with 18; mode 19; mean = 18.7, § = 1.12, sx̅ 0.23, N = 24); eye-lip scales 8-11 (11 left, 10 right in holotype; for sum of left and right, range 16-22, mean = 19.0 S = 1.49, sx̅ = 0.03, N = 24); no enlarged scales on dorsal aspect of head, the scales behind nasal small, granular; supralabials only slightly enlarged, 28-36 (35 bilaterally in holotype; for sum of left and right, range 54-70, mean = 61.25, s = 5.03, s = 1.45, N = 12); infralabials 23-30 (25 left, 24 right in holotype; for sum of left and right, range 47-57; mean = 51.3, = 3.50, sx̅ = 1.01, N = 12); corner of mouth concealed from lateral view by rictal fold, thus defining a scale-lined pocket at corner of mouth; rostral and mental scutes barely visible externally, but extending within mouth as distinct cornifications; middle of lower lip produced forward as a median lobe fitting closely into median notch of upper lip; no mental groove defined by modified scales or median depression. Scales of body juxtaposed, for most part not exposing any granular areas between them; on sides, each scale with prominent conical central cusp that extends backward past margin of base of scale, flanked by a more dorsal and a more ventral cusp, each much less developed than central cusp and often poorly defined; along back, central cusp less prominent, but along midline of belly the central cusp more developed, So that a median belly fold with 3 or 4 longitudinal scale rows is at least suggested; scales at midbody 120-178 (166 in holotype; mean = 147.7, S = 16.32, sx̅ =4.71, N = 12). No anal scute, the cloacal region U-shaped, the arms of the U directed backward as a pair of pockets into which anal glands open and which are continued backward within tail by hemipenes of males; lining of cloaca with granular scales near cloacal lips (AMNH 59886 and MCZ 118765, adult females, preserved with cloaca protruded as scaly tube that expands distally, the lateral pockets being completely everted; this perhaps an artifact of preservation, but probably possible during life, at least for females, thus explaining the extension of scaly skin within lining of cloaca and the deep lateral pockets of cloaca); tail nearly round in cross-section, about 13-20 percent of total length [since most of my specimens are either skinned out between neck and cloaca or else hardened in coils, only general order of magnitude can be determined]. (McDowell 1979: 76)Teeth: Maxillary teeth 16-19 (mode 18; mean = 17.6, S = 0.95; Sy 0.18, N = 29; counts by Stimson of 5 British Museum specimens included), shortest posteriorly, but because of downward curvature of rear of maxilla, tips of all teeth lying virtually on a straight line; palatine teeth 8-10 (mode 9; mean = 9.0, s = 0.42, Sy = 0.09, N = 24); pterygoid teeth 11-16 (mode 15; mean = 13.7, s = 1.33, S% = 0.27, N = 24); palatine-pterygoid teeth gradually diminish ing in length from before backward, last palatine tooth subequal to first pterygoid; last pterygoid tooth beneath pterygoid-ectopterygoid articulation; dentary teeth 13-17 (mode 17; mean = 15.75, 5 = 1.15, S = 0.24, N = 24), longest anteriorly (except for first 1 or 2), the most posterior similar in form to the other teeth. Compound bone of lower jaw without coronoid process, unless this process is represented by a triangular dorsolateral projection located near quadrate articulation; at least in holotype, dentary with two mental foramina (as in A. javanicus) but splenial of simple triangular form without anterodorsal notch (thus, as in A. granulatus); ectopterygoid smoothly arched, not dilated except at its articulations with maxilla and pterygoid; nasal bones fused anteriorly to form pointed median anterior process, suturally distinct posteriorly; at least in holotype, nasals and septomaxillae not in contact with frontal, and frontal-prefrontal contact confined to region dorsal to lachrymal foramen. (McDowell 1979: 76)Hemipenis of holotype 56 mm long, forked for the terminal 3 mm; sulcus spermaticus forked at forking of organ, with prominent lips that have well defined absulcal edges; lips of forked portion of sulcus expanded into pair of smooth pallets; no spines or papillae, but longitudinal folds, one of which fuses proximally with medial lip of sulcus. In AMNH 86183 (Borroloola, Northern Territory), preserved with both hemipenes incompletely everted, organ similar to that of holotype, directed downward and distinctly craniad (as in Colubroidea; in Booidea the everted organ points caudad), narrow and loosely helical. For 5 adult males, hemipenial length 29.0-63.7 mm (mean = 50.5 mm), forked portion 1.5-3.6 mm (mean = 2.6 mm), not significantly correlated with total length (r = 0.589, not significant for 3 degrees of freedom); length of furcation, in percent of total length: 3.7-8.6 (Stimson, pers. comm. finds the organ forked for 5 percent of its length
Acutotyphlops kunuaensis	Serpentes	Typhlopidae	Diagnosis (genus). Species of Acutotyphlops have (1) eye, distinct, (2) snout, acuminate or rounded, (3) head scale arrangement, non-circular, (4) frontorostral, present, (5) nasal, incompletely divided, (6) nasal suture origin, 2nd supralabial (sometimes 1st), (7) suboculars or subpreoculars, present (rarely absent), (8) postoculars, 3–5 (average, 4.10), (9) preocular-labial contact, supralabials 2 & 3, 3rd, or none, (10) midbody scale rows, 26–36 (average, 30.4), (11) scale row reduction, present, (12) total scale rows, 334–542 (average, 415), (13) caudals, 11–31 (average, 20.9), (14) maximum total length, 333–487 (average, 392) mm, (15) total length/midbody diameter, 18–58 (average, 38.2), (16) total length/tail length, 13–100 (average, 31.1), (17) dorsal color, dark brown (rarely golden orange), (18) ventral color, yellowish or gold, (19) dorsum darker than venter, (20) overall, either patternless or with bars or longitudinal lines (Tables 1–2); molecular phylogenetic support (Fig. 1). Acutotyphlops differs from other typhlopids in having a frontorostral scale (Wallach 1995; Wallach et al. 2007a). [HEDGES et al. 2014: 32]. For an alternative diagnosis see PYRON & WALLACH 2014: 57.
Thamnophis copei	Serpentes	Colubridae	DEFINITION (Adelophis). Adelophis are small (maximum length: 479 mm), moderately slender thamnophine snakes. The head is barely wider than the neck, becoming narrower in the snout region, which is subconical; the crown is strongly arched in profile. The eyes are of moderate size, their diameter ranging from about 15.5-18.5% of head length; the pupil is round. The head scales are generally normal for colubrids (somewhat reduced in copei), usually with 1 or 2 nasals, loreal (none in copei), 1 preocular, 2 postoculars, 1 + 2 temporal (usually 1 + 1 in copei); 5 supralabials, the 4th and 5th equally large (5th much larger in copei), the 3rd and 4th entering the eye; 5 or 6 infralabials. Ventrals number 132-137 in females, 132-139 in males. Subcaudals are divided and number 48-57 in females, 50-64 in males. The anal plate is undivided. Dorsal scales are imbricate, strongly keeled, and slightly notched posteriorly without apical pits. The normal scale row formulas are 17.17.17 (foxi) and 15-15-15 (copei). Tail length constitutes about 19-23% of total length in adult females, 20-25.5% in adult males. The 20-24 maxillary teeth are moderately slender and slightly recurved, decreasing slightly in size posteriorly. In A. foxi (no bones save the maxilla have been examined in A. copei) the dorsal nasal laminae are narrow, lanceolate, and in very narrow contact with the premaxilla. The combined frontal bones are nearly one-third again as long as they are broad. The parietal bone has a well-defined shield that iS very broad posteriorly. The quadrate is greatly expanded dorsally, but the supratemporal is reduced. The prefrontal iS as long as it is high, due to a well-developed anterolateral process. The interorbital foramen is large. The basioccipital process is very low and there is no ventral keel on the parasphenoid, which is extremely narrow. The dorsal pattern consists of (foxi) or 3 (copei) light stripes and 2 (copei) or 4 (foxi) dark stripes on a grayish brown or olive brown ground color. In adult foxi the center and posterior edge of each ventral is corn yellow overlaid with buff, the lateral margins brown like the dorsum; in juveniles the venter appears dull white. Observations on ventral coloration in fresh copei are lacking. The top and sides of the head are similar to the dorsal ground color; the labials (except for the anterior supralabials), chin, and throat are colored like the venter. The everted hemipenis of foxi is single with the distal half greatly expanded (3 times wider than the proximal half). The sulcus spermaticus is simple and terminates apically between raised lips. The apical surface and adjacent apical margin are nude. The remainder of the organ is spinose, the spines being very small on the expanded portion, but becoming larger proximally. One enlarged basal hook is immediately adjacent to the sulcus (this hook lacking in copei); two others are on the opposite side of, and somewhat removed from, the sulcus. In A. foxi (no myological data are available for A. copei) the M. adductor mandibulae externus medialis has a slip originating from the anterior part of the supraoccipital crest. The belly of the M. depressor mandibulae is very broad, and the muscle has a slip that originates from the aponeurosis over the dorsal muscles of the neck. The supraoccipital ligament is lacking. (Rossman & Wallach 1987)Comparisons (genera): The differences between Adelophis and Tropidoclonion clearly appear to outweigh their similarities (undivided anal plate and general dorsal pattern). The hemipenis of Adelophis is of a generalized natricine type, similar to those of many species of Thamnophis; that of Tropidoclonion is unique among New World natricines in possessing a pair of long apical papillae (see Dowling, 1959, Figure 1B). Adelophis usually exhibits no dorsal scale row reduction, but one apparently aberrant juvenile specimen of A. foxi has the 17-19-17 formula characteristic of Tropidoclonion. In Tropidoclonion the tail is very short and there are relatively few subcaudals (Tropidoclonion: males 34-47, females 24-40; Adelophis: males 50-60, females 51-54). The posterior genials in Tropidoclonion are markedly shorter than the anterior, much more so than in Adelophis foxi (the posterior are longer in A. copei). The crown of the head is relatively flat in Tropidoclonion, arched in Adelophis (for latter see Figure 3). If one assumes a Thamnophis-like ancestor, Tropidoclonion is more specialized than Adelo phis in the condition of the hemipenis, relative tail length, and very short posterior genials, whereas Adelophis is the more specialized in terms of head shape and the absence of dorsal scale fow reduction. There are also numerous osteological differences between the two genera (the information on Adelophis is based, with the exception of the maxilla, entirely on foxi). Adelophis has: the posterior end of the maxillary shaft extending well beyond the ectopterygoid process (the posterior end of the shaft terminates well in advance of the ectopterygoid process in Tropidoclonion; see Figure 5); the dorsal surface of the paired nasals narrow and lanceolate (Tropidoclonion has the broad winglike lateral extensions typical of generalized New World natricines); the maxillary process of the ectopterygoid relatively broad (narrow in Tropidoclonion) ; supratemporal scarce ly longer than upper edge of its articulation with quadrate, not reaching pro-otic-parietal suture (supratemporal twice as long as its articulation with upper edge of quadrate and reaching the suture in Tropidoclonion) ; parasphenoid process extremely narrow (broad in Tropidoclonion); two-thirds the length of the supraoccipital lies posterior to the supraoccipital crests (less than one half the length is posterior to the crests in Tropidoclonion) ; combined frontals nearly one-third again as long as they are broad (only slightly longer than broad in Tropidoclonion); prefrontal height equal to its length (height much exceeds length in Tropidoclonion) ; dorsomedial surface of retro -articular process of compound bone broader than in Tropidoclonion. (Rossman & Blaney 1968)Comparisons (species): see Adelophis foxi.DEFINITION (copei). The smaller member (maximum total length: 392 mm) of the genus Adelophis, characterized by: IS-IS-IS dorsal scale rows; absence of a loreal; usually a single secondary temporal; the 5th supralabial much larger than the 4th; 133 ventrals in only known female, 132-138 in males; SO subcaudals in only known female, SO-54 in males; tail 19% of total length in only known female, 20-21% in males; dorsal pattern with 3 pale stripes and 2 dark stripes on an olive brown ground color; 23-24 maxillary teeth. (Rossman & Wallach 1987)
Thamnophis foxi	Serpentes	Colubridae	Diagnosis: A species of natricine snake distinguished from its sole congener, Adelophis copei Dugès, by possessing 17-17-17 dorsal scale rows (15-15-15 in copei), a semidivided nasal (entirely divided in 6 of 8 cases in copei), a discrete loreal scale (fused with prefrontal in copei), longer anterior than posterior genials (posterior longer in copei), 4th and 5th supralabials of nearly equal size (5th equal to combined length of 2nd, 3rd, and 4th in copei), six infralabials (five in copei), two posterior tem porals (one in copei), a proportionately longer muzzle (frontal only 28.3 to 28.6 per cent longer than muzzle1 in male foxi, 37.2 to 51.7 per cent longer in male copei?), a proportionately longer tail (23.4 to 25.6 per cent of total length in adult male foxi, 19.8 to 21.0 per cent in male copei), 20 or 21 maxillary teeth (23 of 24 in copei), a pair of dark paravertebral stripes (lacking in copei), and no light lateral stripe (present in copei). The combined characteristics of an undivided anal plate and no dorsal scale row reduction readily distinguish the genus Adelophis from all other New World natricines. (Rossman & Blaney 1968)DEFINITION (foxi). The larger member of the genus Adelophis, characterized by: 17 -17 -17 dorsal scale rows; presence of a loreal; two posterior temporals; 4th and 5th supralabials subequal in size; 132-137 ventrals in females, 133-139 in males; 48-57 subcaudals in females, 52-64 in males; tail 21-23% of total length in females, 21.5-25.5% in males; dorsal pattern with 1 pale stripe and 4 dark stripes on a grayish brown or olive brown ground color; 20-21 maxillary teeth. (Rossman & Wallach 1987)Description of holotype. Dorsal scales in 17 rows throughout, keeled except for those in row 1, which are smooth and enlarged (those in row 2 are weakly keeled and slightly enlarged); ventrals 132; subcaudals 51 ; anal entire. Supralabials 5, third and fourth entering orbit; infralabials 6, 4 in contact with anterior genials, which are longer than posterior genials (A/P= 1.168); nasal semidivided, suture below naris; loreal rectangular; preocular single; postoculars 2 on left, 1 on right; temporals 1+2. Scales on top of head normal; internasal suture 77.4 per cent length of prefrontal suture; frontal 20.3 per cent longer than muzzle, and 31 per cent shorter than parietals. Total length 419 mm, tail length 90.5 (21.6 per cent of total length). (Rossman & Blaney 1968)Teeth: Maxilla with 20 moderately slender, slightly recurved teeth, decreasing slightly in size posteriorly (anteriormost 3 or 4 also smaller). Ten teeth lie anterior to the prefrontal process. (Rossman & Blaney 1968)Coloration: Ventrolateral stripe and dorsal scale rows 1, 2, and 3 oakbuff (Maerz and Paul 13D7) in living animal. Row 4 and rows 7 and 8 coffee (15A11), with black pigment on anterior half of each scale, giving impression of dark lateral stripe and paravertebral stripe. Rows 5 and 6 gray stone (13A2), keels coffee. Vertebral row gray (13A1) with yellow pigment at anterior end of each scale. Center and posterior edge of ventral scales corn yellow (10J5) overlaid with buff (12J5). (Rossman & Blaney 1968)Variation. Coloration of adult paratypes differs from that of holotype primarily in being lighter and brighter (see Figure 1). The anterior end of each scale in rows 1 and 2 of an adult female paratype (LSUMZ 14326) was touched with orange in life. The newly born young have a pattern similar to that of the adults, but in life the coloration is duller (in large part because of the total lack of any yellow or orange pigment) and the dark stripes are less distinct (because of less extensive distribution of the black pigment). The venter appears dull white. In preservative the original epidermal scales slough off easily in both adults and juveniles leaving a uniformly grey dorsum, save for the light and dark stripes. Variation in those characters that show sexual dimorphism or ontogenetic variation is summarized in Table 1. Males tend to have a longer tail, more subcaudals, a longer head, and a shorter muzzle than the females. Larger series of adults probably will reveal that males also have more ventrals and do not attain as great a length as females. Proportional tail length increases ontogenetically, juvenile males having the tail only about as long propor tionately as in adult females. The marked differences between juvenile and adult females in ventral and subcaudal number probably is attributable to the small size of the sample. One juvenile (LSUMZ 14328) is aberrant in several respects: half scutes are present at ventrals 106, 131, and 134; subcaudals 3, 4, 45, 46, and 47 are single; an extra row of dorsal scales appears irregularly between tows 3 and 4 (giving a maximum count of 19), finally dropping out at the level of ventral 71 on the right and 84 on the left; the tail is unusually short for a male, which is reflected by both a low tail length/total length value and a low number of subcaudals (only 1 of the 6 females has fewer). One of the adults (LSUMZ 16411) also has half scutes, all on the left side of the venter (at V 14, 26, 67, and 132). (Rossman & Blaney 1968)
Ameiva ameiva	Sauria	Teiidae	Diagnosis (genus): From all other Teiinae, Ameiva can be distinguished by the combination of the following characters: first supraciliary short, third or fourth supraciliary usually elongate (except in A. wetmorei), five regular parietals (except in A.wetmorei), the prefrontal separated from the nasal, small numerous scales at the heel (except in A. lineolata series), homogeneous manual subdigital lamellae, smooth ventrals and subcaudals, and males lacking preanal spurs [from HARVEY et al. 2012].
