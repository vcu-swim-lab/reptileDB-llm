Dorsum (as preserved) shades of brown, at times with dark violet head and tail, grading to chocolate brown on body; color solid on head and tail, on body rectangular centers of each segment much darker than margins, giving the impression of dark spots; color darker dorsally than ventrally but no white segments (Schwartz & Henderson 1991: 560).For a discussion of geographic variation see Gans & Alexander 1962: 101.
Amphisbaena leeseri	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	Diagnosis: A small form of Amphisbaena with the postrostral head shields paired and without major fusions of head shields, with the midventral segments of each an nulus as wide as long, and with a single pair of round precloacal pores (which is but faintly apparent in females) . Specimens have 216 to 240 body annuli, 14 to 16 caudal annuli, an autotomy constriction at the fifth or sixth postcloacal annulus, 13 to 15 (normally 14) dorsal and 14 to 18 ventral segments to a midbody annulus, and 6 pre-cloacal segments. The color of each animal is dark brown dorsally, lighter ventrally, the color changing by a dropping out of pigmented segments. The posterior 15% of a segment is often light colored. The intersegmental raphes are light. (Gans 1964: 554)Detailed description: Gans 1964: 556.
Amphisbaena leucocephala	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	DIAGNOSIS: A large-sized species of Amphisbaena, without major fusions of head shields; with a rounded snout on a relatively blunt head that continues into the trunk without nuchal constriction or posterior widening; and with large parietals equalling the frontals in size. The form has 233 to 240 body annuli; 26 to 27 caudal annuli, the last two poorly inscribed, and the terminal ones with the segments swollen. The sixth caudal annulus narrows sharply into an autotomy constriction. A midbody annulus has 18 to 20 dorsal and 21 to 22 ventral segments. The precloacal row bears 12 small round pores. Only the lateral sulci are strongly indicated. Specimens are brown dorsally and lighter ventrally, the brown color proceeding to the end of the sixth body annulus, so that the head and neck are light colored. The ventral countershading occurs more or less gradually along the sides, close to the lateral sulcus. There is some tendency for central pigment accentuation on dorsal segments and dropping out of pigment by segments. (Gans 1965).DESCRIPTION: The following description rests primarily on the type as the DZ specimen was not at hand when this was written. Figure 12 shows dorsal, lateral and ventral views of the head, Figure 13, dorsal and ventral views at midbody to indicate segment proportions, and Figure 14 a ventral view of cloaca and tail to characterize appearance of the pore row and the autotomy site. Figure 2 graphs meristic characters in comparison with those of A. pretrei, and Figure 3 shows body proportions. The meristic data are given in Table 1. This is a large-sized species of Amphisbaena of uniform dark brown dorsal and lighter ventral coloration. The dorsal darkening is achieved by a more or less uniform pigmentation of the entire segment, though the fading seems to be accentuated near the segment margins and along the intersegmental raphes and interannular sutures so that the segment centers appear darker. The head anterior to the fifth body annulus and the distal tip of the tail are completely unpigmented. The ventral countershading seems to occur by a dropping out of pigmentation at or near the lateral sulcus; it is not clear whether this occurs by segmental dropouts or by rapid fading. The autotomy annulus shows no special pigmentation. The head segmentation shows no major fusions. It is characterized by the enormous prefrontals and by an asymmetrical pair of parietals, averaging to a size equal to that of the frontals. The snout is relatively blunt and high, but slopes from the level of the parietal to that of the nasals. Temporal bulges are noticeable but not marked. The nuchal constriction is faint and the trunk diameter changes only gradually. The trunk is oval in cross section and shows some vertical compression. The rostral is somewhat larger than the first supralabial and almost invisible in dorsal view. Pairs of rectangular nasals, wide prefrontals more than twice their size, smaller pentagonal frontals, and first parietals equal to these follow in sequence, as may small second (and smaller third) parietals. The posterior edge of the frontals lies along the first portion of the first supralabial, somewhat anterior to the angulus oris. There are three supralabials, the first the smallest, the second the largest. The small and irregularly shaped postsupralabial is approximately one-third the size of the third supralabial. The supralabial sutures run between 450 and 750 anteriorly to the edge of the mouth, except for the posterior edge of the third which curves broadly caudad. The ocular is diamond-shaped, the eye relatively large. The mental roughly corresponds to the rostral in extent along the labial edge. It is somewhat larger than the first supralabial and its central process forms a broad, straight raphe with the much larger postmental. Laterally the postmental is in contact with the small first and very large second infralabials, and with the tips of the large malars, whose lateral extremities reach the elongate third infralabials. The posterior edge of the postmental is enclosed between a pair of dropshaped segments of the first postgenial row. The second postgenial row consists of five segments, the median and lateral ones being wedge-shaped and inserting some slight distance between the segments of the first row. The posterior tips of the elongate third infralabials enclose the ventral part of the first body annulus; nine segments, the lateralmost the widest, lie in the position of postmalars. Dorsally this annulus comprises the postsupralabials, and a very large temporal and a large postocular that contact the lateral edges of the frontals and (asymmetrically) the parietals. The second body annulus splits dorsally to form a dorsal intercalated half-annulus, all of the segments of this area being enlarged, irregular, and variously polygonal. There are 233 to 240 body annuli from the back of the third supralabials up to and including the pore-bearing precloacals. The ventral portions of the second through seventh annuli show some complexing and are composed of rounded rather than rectangular segments. The third through ninth annuli are narrower on their lateral and dorsal aspects than are the following ones and the interannular raphes appear capable of greater bending in that they are wide and filled with tiny fragments. The annular pattern is regular along the trunk and the only modification occurs in the cloacal region. There are 18 to 20 dorsal and 21 to '22 ventral segments to a midbody annulus, with considerable irregularity even between adjacent segments. There is a row of 12 small, but clearly marked, round precloacal pores in the male holotype and in the unsexed DZ specimen. Eight to ten segments form the shallow, segment-shaped precloacal shield, and 14 to 18 small postcloacals fringe the posterior edge. There are four lateral and six caudal annuli up to and including the markedly narrowed autotomy annulus. Caudal annuli number 26 to 27, the last three indicated only by very shallow raphes and represented as inscribed markings on the bluntly ridged caudal tip. Most of the dorsal and lateral segments on the tip appear faintly convex. The tail is bluntly oval at its base, swells laterally beyond the autotomy constriction, and then shows some faint lateral compression toward the distal tip. The lateral sulci are clearly marked after the 45th body annulus; at midbody they are about as wide as a fringing segment and filled with several kinds o'f irregular segments. Dorsal and ventral sulci are poorly indicated by alignment of intersegmental raphes. The middorsal segments are approximately 1.5 times as long as wide, the midventral segments about 1.4 times as wide as long, with some segment variability along the trunk (Gans 1965).
Amphisbaena lumbricalis	Sauria	Amphisbaenidae	DIAGNOSIS: Very slender. Preanal pores cicatricial, usually 4, rarely 2, 5 or 6. Body annuli 225-247, tail annuli 20-26. Autotomy level not apparent in the intact tail, breaks on annuli 6-10. Segments to a midbody annulus 12-16/16-20. No major fusions of head scales. Prefrontals the largest scales on top of the head. Parietals veiy variable, irregular. Three upper and three lower labials, in both cases the second by far the largest. (Vanzolini 1996)DESCRIPTION: (Figures 1-3) A small form, maximum rostro-anal length (72 specimens) 156 mm. Head slightly arcuate in profile, snout rounded in dorsal view. Tail relatively short, cylindrical proximally, becoming progressively a little thinner on the distal two thirds; terminal cap slightly acuminate, little incised. Autotomy level not noticeable on the intact tail, broken tails (19 specimens) with 5-9 annuli remaining. Median dorsal sutures of the head in the following order of decreasing length: prefrontal, frontal, nasal. Prefrontals very large. Frontals forming together a rough diamond, with the front edges tending to a bow-like curve. Parietal series varying from a proper transverse row, with two larger polygonal scales on the center, to an irregular series, with diverse divisions and fusions, the latter occasionally extensive. Nasal scale large, the nostril near the front edge, a little below the middle. Three upper labials, the second by far the largest, the third high, narrowly meeting or missing the postocular. Ocular diamond-shaped; the eye, sitting on the front half, varies from invisible to a very definite black spot. Postocular large, polygonal, meeting above the frontal and the parietal series. Below the postocular a short vertical row of two scales, the lower one in a post-labial position, corresponding to the post-genial row ventrally. Symphysial moderate, a little wider in front. Three lower labials, the second by far the largest. Postsymphysial large, seven- or eight-sided. Lateral geniais (nomenclature as in Vanzolini, 1991) moderate. Anterior medial genials two, fairly regular, embracing from behind the postsymphysial. Second row of medial genials with three irregular elements. Postgenials four or five on each side, with diverse types of fusions. On the body no ventral or dorsal sulci; lateral sulci always present, though varying in degree of expression. Pores little marked, not definite and rounded, but scar-like, hard to see. Of 72 specimens, 67 with 4 pores, 1 with 2, 2 with 5 and 2 with 6. Preanal flap semicircular, with 8 scales. Dorsal parts reddish brown, head a little lighter. Edges of segments very slightly lighter than the center, without, however, taking a reticulate appearance. Below the lateral sulci the borders of the segments become progressively lighter, resulting in 5-6 rows of light segments with a dark center. Ventral parts of the body immaculate, waxy yellow to light cream. Underside of tail with a variable area of light segments with dark spots on the Middle (Vanzolini 1996)

Boa constrictor	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis (constrictor in Honduras): “Boa constrictor differs from all other Honduran snakes by the combination of having enlarged ventral scales that do not extend the entire width of the venter, no enlarged scales on the top of the head, mostly entire subcaudal scales, smooth dorsal scales in more than 60 rows at midbody, a huge adult size, and in lacking labial pits.” (McCranie 2011: 61)Detailed description (constrictor): McCranie 2011: 62Diagnosis (longicauda)”: Boa constrictor longicauda may be distinguished from all conspecifics by the much longer tail (in the male) and hemipenis. Additionally, it may be distinguished from B. c. imperator by fewer dorsal body bloches (20-21 in longicauda, 22 or more in imperator), the longitudinal mid-dorsal band without projections to the eyes, and the generally darker head and body coloration, without tan or red color on the tail in adults; from B. c. constrictor by lack of red coloration on the tail, fewer midbody scale rows (a maximum of 76, usually fewer in longicauda, a minimum of 81, usually several more in constrictor), the darker body pattern without tan color, and the grey, black-spotted head in adults; from B. c. ortonii by the much darker overall coloration, lack of red tail color and lower ventral count (246-252 in ortonii); from B. c. melanogaster (sensu Langhammer, 1983) by the much longer tail, lack of melanistic ventral coloration, and fewer middorsal scale rows (86 or more in melanogaster); from B. c. amarali by the overall darker coloration, greater number of subcaudals (43-52 in amarali), and fewer dorsal body saddles (22 or more in amarali); and from B. c. occidentalis by the greater number of subcaudals (45-46 in occidentalis), and the very different color patterns (a blackish network or reticulum on a cream ground color in occidentalis) [from Price & Russo 1991].Diagnosis (orophias): A Constrictor with a prominent snout and a convex canthus; 65 to 75 dorsal scale rows at midbody, 270 to 288 ventrals, and 27 to 31 distinct, subrectangular, dark dorsal saddles to the level of the anus; dorsal ground color rich brown; venter white with black or grey spotting pronounced; subocular stripe distinct and complete; loreal stripe largely obsolete; dark pigment on chin and infralabials not closely corresponding to the facial stripes [Lazell 1964: 261].

Ungaliophis continentalis	Serpentes	Boidae	Definition (genus). “(Modified from Bogert, 1968a) Relatively small tropidopheids (760 mm TL.) with the head distinct from neck, relatively slender and compressed body and a short, prehensile tail (8.5-12.4% of TL). Males have well-developed anal spurs; these may be present, although not as well developed, in some females. The eye is moderate in size (its diameter is greater than its distance to the lip) with a vertically elliptical pupil. The anterior dorsal cephalic scales are relatively large, especially the frontal and the single prefrontal. The parietals are practically indistinguishable from the dorsals. There are two nasals (with nostril in anterior nasal), one loreal and one preocular, and 2-3 postoculars. Supralabials number 8-10 (two or three reaching the eye), and infralabials 9-11, the first pair of the latter in broad contact behind the moderately large mental, followed posteriorly by 2-3 pairs of chin shields. Tubercles are present on all cephalic scales. The dorsal scales are smooth (except for minute tubercles), in 19-25 rows at midbody, reducing to 17 or 15 near the vent. Ventral scales range from 204 to 258. Subcaudals are single, numbering 39-46. The anal plate is also single, and the tail ends in a blunt spine. The premaxilla is toothless and has an ascending process. The maxillae have 12-15 teeth, the first 4-5 larger and separated from the posterior ones by a short a diastema, all decreasing in size posteriorly. The palatine has 5-8, the pterygoid 11-15, and the dentary 13-15 teeth. The hemipenes are relatively long and bilobed. The sulcus spermaticus appears to bifurcate near the base, and each branch of the sulcus extends to the terminus of the lobe. The basal portion is plicate and calyces on the lobes lack crenate edges.” (Villa & Wilson 1990) Diagnosis (genus). “These small, slender-bodied boas differ from all other Tropidopheidae by having a relatively enormous, azygous prefrontal, and 19-25 rows of dorsal scales at midbody.” (Villa & Wilson 1990)Diagnosis (continentalis). A species of Ungaliophis with 25 rows of scales at midbody, reducing to 15at the vent. Color is grayish brown with dark oval vertebral and paravertebral blotches. The venter is heavily stippled with black. The rostral is in broad contact with the prefrontal, separating the small internasals. The prefrontal and frontal are subequal in size, or the prefrontal somewhat larger. Supraoculars are small, less than half the area of the frontal.There are 9-10 supralabials, two entering the orbit; 2 postoculars; and 14 maxillary teeth.

Ungaliophis panamensis	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis: A species of Ungaliophis with 19-23 (rarely 25) rows of scales at midbody, reducing to 17 at the vent. Color is brown with dark diamond- or hourglass-shaped vertebral and triangular paravertebral blotches. The venter is heavily pigmented with prominent ovoid blotches running across the ventrals at least on the posterior half of the body. The rostral is separated from the prefrontal by the internasals. The prefrontal is considerably larger than the frontal. Supraoculars are relatively large, larger than half the area of the frontal. There are 7-9 supralabials, two or three entering the orbit, and 2-3 postoculars. There are 13-15 maxillary teeth. (Villa & Wilson 1990)
Bitis atropos	Serpentes	Viperidae	DIAGNOSIS (unicolor): Head scaling somewhat similar to that in typical atropos, but less strongly keeled and, over back of head, not so markedly elongate; outermost row of scales on body practically smooth anteriorly and but feebly keeled posteriorly; almost uniformly khaki to reddish brown above and apparently a smaller snake than typical atropos.
Bitis rubida	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis: “Bitis rubida is characterized by lacking, or having greatly reduced, elongate scales (*horns') in the supraorbital region, and by having a drab, usually reddish, dorsal colouration. It can be distinguished from other small Bits by various scutellation features. It differs from B. xeropaga in having fewer ASR than MSR (ASR equal to or greater in number than MSR in B. xeropaga; Haacke 1975), and lower ventral scale counts in both sexes (B. xeropaga males 147-154, mean 151.5; females 151-155, mean 152.4; Haacke 1975). It differs from B. atropos in having a raised supraorbital ridge. It differs from sympatric and southern populations of Bitis cornuta in having lower ventral scale counts in both sexes, fewer circumorbitals, and usually 29 MSR. Bitis cornuta usually has 27 MSR and a slightly higher number of dorsal blotches. It also differs from B. rubida in always having prominent supraorbital a 'horns' and usually a contrasting colour pattern of grey, white and black (
Montatheris hindii	Serpentes	Viperidae	Diagnosis (genus): “All dorsal head shields small and keeled; rostral horizontally divided, the suprarostral separated from the nasals by 'nasorostrals' (or lateral suprarostrals: Figure Ib); regular duplication of transverse dorsal scale rows, which have distinctive microornamentation consisting of numerous elongate erect lamellae (Figure 2b); subcaudals paired. Vomerine process of premaxilla much reduced (Figure 4b); palatine-pterygoid articulation a simple overlapping joint; intra-pulmonary bronchus short.

(Smith 1940: 62)Color. General ground color light tan, very slightly suffused with pink, rather heavily stippled with dark brown; a series of diagonal brown blotches, sometimes dark-edged anteriorly, down middle of back; blotches extending over six to eight rows of scales transversely, about three longitudinally; they are connected diagonally by narrower extensions of the same color about one and one-half to two scales wide, so that the general effect is a zigzag line down the back; small dark blotches, arranged in two rows, very dimly evident on the sides; a light postocular stripe, one and one-half to two scales broad, not sharply defined, extends from eye through temporal region onto anterior part of neck, there disappearing; below this a somewhat narrower dark brown stripe which involves the upper half of the posterior supraocular and disappears on side of neck; supralabials light except anterior scales; a dim, somewhat star-shaped light mark on occiput; upper surface of head otherwise dark brown. Infralabials, except anterior ones, pinkish cream, stippled with dark brown, and with a few well-defined small, very dark spots irregularly arranged; another dark spot, larger but not so well defined, on posterolateral gular region. Mental and anterior infralabials gray, heavily pigmented; other ventral head shields with scattered pigment. Belly and ventral surface of tail heavily pigmented, more posteriorly than anteriorly, with scattered light areas.

(Smith 1940: 62)Variation (garciai). In ventral and caudal counts the series is amazingly uniform. All have 146 ventrals, and the two with complete tails have 40 caudale (both males). In the two paratypes (U. S. National Museum and E.H.T.-H.M.S. respectively) the scale rows are 25-21-17, 23-21-17; supralabials 12-14, 10-11; infralabials 11-11, 11-12; scales between "horns" 13, 10; total length 407 mm., 449 mm.; tail 55 mm., 51 mm. The dorsal pattern of the female is obscure.  (Smith 1940: 62)Comparisons (garciai). The species is somewhat similar to Trimeresurus undulatus, but differs markedly in having entire instead of divided subcaudals, as well as in other less obvious characters. There seems to be no other described species similar to it. (Smith 1940: 62)

Python anchietae	Serpentes	Pythonidae	Description: The dorsum of the head is the same color as the body. Two stripes, a yellow one with a black one beneath it, run along the sides of the head on each side from the nostril through the eye to the neck. The upper and lower labials are pale. The venter is whitish. The nasal may be single or divided. There are 4-5 preoculars, 2 or more postoculars, 1or more supraoculars, and 2-3 suboculars. There are 15-18 perioculars and about 10 interoculars. There are 12-15 upper labials, none of which is in contact with the eye. Four or five of the upper labials have sensory pits. There are 15-16 lower labials. The dorsal scales are arranged in 55-61 straight rows. There are 253-267 ventrals and 46-57 divided subcaudals. The cloacal scale may be single or divided (Chippaux & Jackson 2019: 66).
Python curtus	Serpentes	Pythonidae	Description: Top of body is brownish grey, with a series of longitudinal dark, irregular sub-rectangular blotches, sometimes as broad as body; flanks have a longitudinal series of large blotches with black edges; sides of snout have dark stripes; post-ocular pattern comprises black triangular blotches, widening to 4-6 scales at angle of jaws and coalescing with anterior labial blotch of neck; has a pale post-ocular stripe with dark smudges; chin and belly are plain cream or white. Body is short and robust; head is elongate, flat and distinct from neck; vertebral region is ridged; tail is short; cloacal spurs are present (Das 2012: 16).
Python molurus	Serpentes	Pythonidae	Diagnosis (genus): Diagnosis: Maxillary, palatine and pterygoid bones movable; trans-palatine present; pterygoid extending to quadrate or mandible; supratemporal present, attached scalelike to skull, suspending quadrate. Both jaws with teeth, anterior ones of both jaws elongated and curved; a coronoid present; vestiges of pelvis and legs terminating in a clawlike spur visible on each side of vent. Head with enlarged scales; part of labials bearing pits; scales numerous, in 60-75 scalerows. (Taylor 1965: 664)Description (species): Thick-bodied, smooth-scaled. Head broader than neck; at snout tip and first two upper lip scales have heat sensitive pits. Upper surface eye has vertical pupil. Scale of head has large scales of different shapes and sizes. Yellowish to brown with asymmetrical dark brown, black-edged blotches. Tip of arrow-head mark on head indistinct in adults; tongue and parts of head pale pink. Two dark streaks on side of head, one below, the other through/behind eye. Underside white or yellowish. (Russell's Viper has keeled scales and a pattern similar in color, but with symmetrical blotches that are are either oval with pointed ends, or round. Also, the upper head scales are small). (Whitaker & Captain 2007: 78)Scalation (species): Scales in 60-75 rows, smooth. Ventral 253-270, distinctly narrower than width of belly; anal undivided; subcaudals 58-73, paired. Rostral and first 2 supralabials pitted; supralabials 11-13 (6th or 7th touching eye). (Whitaker & Captain 2007: 78)
Python natalensis	Serpentes	Pythonidae	Diagnosis: P. natalensis can be distinguished from P. sebae in the pattern on the side of the head: in P. natalensis, the dark patch in front of and posterior to the eye is paler and narrower than in P. sebae, giving the appearance of a dark stripe as opposed to a yellow stripe at the level of the eye. The overall coloration of P. natalensis, though similar to P. sebae, is drabber. The scales on the dorsum of the head are small and medium sized in P. natalensis as opposed to medium and large sized in P. sebae, and there are small differences in some of the other head scale counts. The nasal may be single or divided. There are 2-3 preoculars, 3-4 postoculars, 2-3 supraoculars, and a variable number of suboculars. There are 8-13 perioculars and 6-10 interoculars. There are 10-16 upper labials, none of which is in contact with the eye. There are sensory pits on two of the upper labials, as well as smaller ones on three of the lower labials. There are 17-20 lower labials. The dorsal scales are arranged in 76-99 straight rows. There are 260-291 ventrals and 63-84 divided subcaudals. The cloacal scale may be single or divided (Chippaux & Jackson 2019: 67).
Python regius	Serpentes	Pythonidae	Description: The dorsal coloration is dark overall with a pattern of large round or oval yellow spots outlined in black. The dorsum of the head is black. There is a yellow stripe from nostril to eye on each side of the head and two yel- low stripes posterior to the eye. The upper and lower labials are pale. The venter is whitish. The nasal is single. There are 2-4 preoculars, 3-4 postoculars, 1-2 supraocu- lars, and no suboculars. There are 9-12(5) or (5,6) or (6) upper labials. Three or four of the upper labials have sensory pits. There are 15 or so lower labials. The dorsal scales are arranged in 51-63 straight rows. There are 191-207 ventrals and 28-37 divided sub- caudals. The cloacal scale may be single or divided ((Chippaux & Jackson 2019: 69).
