Charina bottae	Serpentes	Boidae	Definition (genus). Charina is a small boa (maximal total length, 800 mm) with a short, blunt tail capped by a rounded plate. The head is not distinct from the neck and has large, irregular plates on the dorsal surface. The snout is short, broad, and slightly depressed. The eye is small with a vertical pupil. Chin scales are small, without enlarged plates. Dorsal scales are small, width subequal to length, smooth, and in 32-53 rows. Ventrals range from 182-231. Subcaudals are in a single series, 24-43 in number. The anal plate is entire. The hemipenis is single, clavate and transversely plicate with an apically forked sulcus. The basal portion is smooth. Pelvic spurs are present in both sexes, smaller in females, and often difficult to see. The dorsum typically is uniform in color, ranging from olive green to camel tan, reddish-brown, medium brown and dark chocolate brown. The venter is yellowish and may be mottled with orange or brown. The young generally are pink to tan above and light yellow to cream below. (Stewart 1977)DEFINITION (bottae).

It differs from C. batesii by reduced number of scales across snout at level of the suture between third and fourth supralabials (2–6, mean = 3.4 +/- 1.1 in C. caninus| 3–12, mean = 6.9 +/- 1.6 in C. batesii), absence of  <span style="color: red;">mid-dorsal longitudinal stripe</span> ( <span style="color: green;">present</span>  or  <span style="color: green;">absent</span>  in C. batesii), and absence or near-absence of lateral blotches (0–11, mean = 1.3 +/- 2.7 in C. caninus| 0–38, mean = 18.1 +/- 8.2 in C. batesii) <span style="color: red;">juvenile dorsal coloration</span> (in alcohol) <span style="color: green;">pale yellow to beige</span> (in life, red-orange) in specimens 380– 516 mm SVL. Mitochondrial DNA sequence differences between Guiana Shield samples (C. caninus) and those from Amazonia (C. batesii) ranged from 3.1–16.2% (Vidal et al., 2005). [from HENDERSON eta l. 2009].<br>

Corallus cookii	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis: Corallus cooki is most easily distinguished from other members of the C. hortulanus complex by its color pattern. It lacks the color variation (pale yellow, orange, red, many shades of brown) found in C. hortulanus and C. grenadensis. Likewise, the main element of the dorsal pattern is relatively constant, and it rarely occurs in populations outside of St. Vincent. The diamond-shape pattern characteristic of C. ruschenbergerii does not occur in this species. Corallus cooki is distinguishable from C. hortulanus by  <span style="color: red;">maximum number of dorsal scale rows</span> : invariably  <span style="color: green;">less than 50</span>  in C. cooki ( <span style="color: red;">39–48</span> | x = <span style="color: green;">43.9 +/- 0.34</span> ) and almost always more than 50 in C. hortulanus (47– 63| x = 55.0 +/- 0.17| specimens with  <span style="color: green;">less than 50</span>  occur occasionally in Guyana, Suriname, Bolivia, and Peru) [from HENDERSON 1997].<br>

<br>
Corallus hortulana	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis: Corallus hortulanus is distinguishable from other species in the complex by the maximum number of  <span style="color: red;">dorsal scale rows</span> (almost always over 50 in hortulanus, always  <span style="color: green;">less than 50</span>  in cooki, grenadensis, and ruschenbergerii). Populations of hortulanus with  <span style="color: green;">less than 50</span>  <span style="color: red;">dorsal scale rows</span>  occur in Guyana, Suriname, Bolivia, and Peru. In general, hortulanus has  <span style="color: green;">higher counts</span>  for  <span style="color: red;">meristic characters</span>  than other members of the complex. The shape of the  <span style="color: red;">main element in the dorsal pattern at midbody</span>  is more or less ellipsoidal, whereas it is a ragged hourglass in cooki and is usually  <span style="color: green;">spade-shaped</span>  in grenadensis [from HENDERSON 1997].<br>
<br>
Corallus ruschenbergerii	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis: Corallus ruschenbergerii is easily distinguished from all other species of Corallus except C. grenadensis. The maximum number of dorsal scale rows in C. cropanii is fewer than 35 (38–48 in C. ruschenbergerii). Corallus annulatus, the only congener with which there is significant sympatry, has a maximum of 50–57 dorsal scale rows and only 79–87 subcaudals (94–115 in C. ruschenbergerii). Corallus caninus has a maximum of 63–77 dorsal scale rows, and 186–209 ventrals (250–272 in C. ruschenbergerii). With very few exceptions, C. hortulanus from mainland South America and Ilha Grande off southeastern Brazil have  <span style="color: green;">50 or more</span>  <span style="color: red;">maximum dorsal scale rows</span> (individuals from Guyana, Suriname, Peru, and Bolivia rarely have 47 or 48) and  <span style="color: red;">color and pattern</span>  are  <span style="color: green;">extremely variable</span> Corallus from St. Vincent and the Grenada Bank are the shortest and most slender of the Neotropical tree boas, and this can be related to aspects of their ecology (see below). They exhibit great overlap in lepidosis with C. ruschenbergerii, but C. ruschenbergerii is much larger (maximum  <span style="color: red;">svl</span>  in West Indian Corallus is  <span style="color: green;">1625 mm</span> ), and C. grenadensis exhibits tremendous  <span style="color: red;">color and pattern</span>  variation. Despite the pattern variation in the West Indian populations, none of it duplicates that found in C. ruschenbergerii, with the exception of  <span style="color: red;">yellow-brown individuals</span>  that have  <span style="color: green;">no discernible pattern</span> [from HENDERSON 1997].<br>

Exiliboa placata	Serpentes	Boidae	DIAGNOSIS (GENUS): “A small, nearly unicolored, prehensile-tailed boa, characterized by its possession of a large azygous internasal in broad contact with the rostral, and flanked on each side by a single nasal. This peculiar configuration of the scales readily distinguishes Exiliboa from Ungaliophis and from Tropidophis, al members of which have paired internasals and divided nasal plates (fig. 1). Exiliboa retains a pair of prefrontals in contrast to the azygous prefrontal of Ungaliophis, and the two pairs of prefrontals normally present on Tropidophis. The loreal is retained by Exiliboa, whereas it is absent from, or fused with the anterior prefrontal of, Tropidophis. The mental groove of Exiliboa is bordered by only three pairs of shields, but the groove is bordered by four scales in Ungaliophis and by four or five in Tropidophis. Furthermore, the female of Exiliboa differs from that of other dwarf boas in its retention of external vestiges of limbs. “ (Bogert 1968) Comparisons (genus): “Trachyboa, an inhabitant of lowland forests in northern South America and Panama, is more distantly related, although it resembles Exiliboa in having the nostril in an undivided nasal, and it possesses comparable numbers of ventrals and subcaudals. Most of the cephalic plates have been replaced by scales on Trachyboa, which differs further in having from 29 to 31 rows of scales at midbody, in contrast to 21 on Exiliboa. Moreover, well-developed hypapophyses are present on al vertebrae of Trachyboa, but lacking on the precaudal vertebrae of Exiliboa. Trachyboa is an extremely rugose snake, adaptively specialized to forage on the surface (Bogert, 1968), unlike the comparatively slender, smooth-scaled dwarf boa from Oaxaca, which is evidently semifossorial.” (Bogert 1968)DEFINITION OF THE GENUS: “Exiliboa is a relatively small member of the family Boidae, with over-all dimensions that may not greatly exceed 50 cm. The trunk is les strongly compressed toward the constriction behind the head. The more strongly compressed prehensile tail, which comprises slightly more than 10 per cent of the total length, terminates in a blunt spine. Spurs, present on the female (fig. 2), are presumably more strongly developed on males. The large rostral is in broad contact posteriorly with a large undivided internasal, and on each side the rostral is followed by an undivided nasal containing the nostril. There is a pair of prefrontals, and the frontal is flanked by the supraoculars and the scalelike vestiges of the parietals. In addition to the single nasal on each side of the head, there are a loreal, a preocular, two postoculars, and seven supralabials, two of which enter the orbit. On the under side of the head the first supralabials meet on a broad suture separating the large mental from a pair of small chin-shields. The mental groove is bordered by the first supralabials and two pairs of chin-shields. The dorsal scales are smooth, in 19 rows anteriorly, but increasing to 21 at midbody and diminishing to 15 at the vent. The anal plate and sub-caudals are undivided. The iris is black, and the vertical pupil is semi-elliptic,as shown infigure3.The tongue is black and relatively short. From 17 to 19 teeth are present on the maxilla, 19 on the dentary| the teeth are relatively long and slender anteriorly, but progressively smaller toward the rear. Hypapophyses are restricted to a few vertebrae at the anterior end of the trunk. The tracheal lung is followed by the right lung, without any demarcation between them. There is no vestige of the left lung. The kidneys are lobulated, and situated well toward the rear of the body cavity.” (Bogert 1968)DIAGNOSIS (species): “As noted in the discussion of generic characters, the boas of the genera Ungaliophis and Tropidophis appear to be the nearest living relatives of the dwarf boa discovered in Oaxaca. The peculiarities of Exiliboa that serve to distinguish it from these other genera, therefore, are also diagnostic of E. placata. The species differs from al other boas in Mexico in having the scales arranged in 21 rows at midbody, and in having a large azygous internasal that extends across the snout to an undivided nasal and the anterior portion of the loreal on each side. The number of midbody scale rows varies from 19 to 25 in Ungaliophis, but Mexican representatives of the genus have 25| many more scale rows are present on Loxocemus, Lichanura, and Boa, the only other genera of the family Boidae known to occur in Mexico.” (Bogert 1968)DESCRIPTION OF THE HOLOTYPE: “A female,possibly immature,withan over-all length of 412 mm., and a tail 45 mm. in length that comprises 10.9 per cent of the total length. The head is 14.5 mm. in length and 8.0 mm. in width, and the diameter of the trunk behind the head is 5.0 mm. The trunk is increasingly more compressed toward the base of the tail, where it is appreciably higher than wide. The short, laterally flattened tail tapers rapidly to a blunt scale at the end. The dorsal scales, all smooth, are disposed in 21 rows immediately behind the head, in 19 rows on the anterior portion of the trunk, increase in number to 21 at midbody, and diminish to 15 at the base of the tail. In the following dorsal scale formula the figures in parentheses are the lateral rows indicated by number, and the paravertebral rows by P, followed by the ventral count where the change occurs: [scale formula here] There are 166 ventrals, followed by an undivided anal and 24 undivided subcaudals, not counting the blunt scale on the end of the tail. The rostral is appreciably wider than high (2.9 mm. in width, 1.7 mm. in height) and visible from above, where the median portion of it reaches a broad, undivided internasal, the largest scale on the head. Behind the internasal there are two large prefrontals in broad contact with the frontal, and the anterior end of the supraocular. The frontal, with a blunt apex behind the suture of the paired prefrontals, is flanked laterally by supraoculars, followed by vestiges of the parietals. The scalelike parietals extend to a median scale behind the tapered end of the frontal (fig. 3). On each side of the head the rostral is in broad contact with the first supralabial and the nasal on each side. The nostril is near the middle of an undivided nasal situated above the first supralabial and bordered posteriorly by the loreal, which lies below the suture between the internasal and the prefrontal. The preocular is approximately the size and shape of the rectangular loreal in front of it, but slightly smaller than the nasal. The distance between the eye and the border of the mouth is less than the diameter of the eye. The pupil is vertical and semi-elliptical, rounded above but pointed below. Two postoculars are followed by two scales between the supralabials and the vestiges of the parietal. There are seven supralabials, the first and second of which reach the loreal on the left, but on the right, a small portion of the third supra-labial reaches the loreal. The third and fourth supralabials reach the eye| the third supralabial is largest. The lower margin of the mouth is bordered by seven infralabials on each side. The anteriormost infralabials, which are much larger than the others, meet on a broad suture behind the blunt apex of a large mental, thus separating it from a pair of short chin-shields. These are followed by a second pair of much more slender chin-shields, which meet on the mental groove| these are longer but indistinguishable in other respects from the first of four gular scales that separate the mental groove from the first ventral. The scales in contact with the outer edges of the second pair of chin-shields are in the same row as those bordering the ventral scales posteriorly. Small pustules, present on all cephalic plates, are more numerous on the sides of the head, particularly on the lips. The dorsum is almost uniformly black, although the scales on the trunk are more heavily pigmented near the middle than at their margins. The gular scales are margined with gray, which is to some extent true of the ventrals. The only conspicuous marking, however, is an immaculate white area that covers the anal scute, the contiguous scales, as well as the margin of the penultimate ventral. Faint traces of a narrow light stripe extend through the upper portions of the supralabials from the angle of the mouth (figs. 4 and 5). (Bogert 1968)<br>

Corallus batesii	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis: Distinguishable from all other species of Corallus (except C. caninus) based on its  <span style="color: green;">green</span>  <span style="color: red;">dorsal ground color</span> (rarely black or nearly so) with enamel-white markings on the dorsum (never immaculate  <span style="color: green;">green</span> ). Juveniles are usuallyred-orange with enamel-white markings (other species of Corallus are various shades of gray, brown, red, and yellow as adults, always with patterns consisting of more than just white markings). Differs from C. caninus by the number of scales across snout at level of suture between the third and fourth supralabials (3–12, mean = 6.9 +/- 1.6 in C. batesii| 2– 6, mean = 3.4 +/- 1.1 in C. caninus), presence or absence of  <span style="color: red;">mid-dorsal longitudinal stripe</span> ( <span style="color: green;">absent</span>  in C. caninus), and lateral blotches rarely  <span style="color: green;">absent</span> (0–38, mean = 18.1 +/- 8.2 in C. batesii| 0–11, mean = 1.3 +/- 2.7 in C. caninus). Mitochondrial DNA sequence differences between Amazonia samples (C. batesii) and those from the Guiana Shield (C. caninus) ranged from 3.1–16.2% (Vidal et al., 2005) [from HENDERSON et al. 2009].<br>

Candoia paulsoni	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis and definition. A member of the Candoia carinata complex, differing from other complexes of the genus in having a broad, tlat, slanted, bevel-like, overhung snout, supralabials entering orbit, subcaudals 35 or more, and ventrals less than 203. Differing from members of the Candoia carinata subcomplex in always lacking a distinctive postanal white spot| scales in second row of dorsals never keeled| usually one or more enlarged supraoculars reaching orbit on both sides (92%)| anterior scale rows usually (88%) 29 or more| maximum scale rows usually (89%) 36 or more| posterior scale rows usually (74%) 25 or more| ventrals minus caudals usually (93%) 136 or more| tail/totallength ratio usually (85%) .14 or less| usually (77%) two or more enlarged supraoculars reaching orbit on one or both sides| <span style="color: red;">lip/eye diameter ratio</span>  usually (57%) .61 ormore. (Smith et al. 1981: 297)Diagnosis and definition (vindumi). A member of the paulsoni subeomplex, reaehing a relatively large size (at least 1200 mm TTL), and laeking a postanal white spot or keels anywhere on seeond row of dorsals| ventrals minus eaudals 140-148| tailltotallength ratio usually .14 or less (88%, 29 of 33)| 2 or more enlarged supraoculars usually reaehing eye on both sides (83%, 30 of 36)| and lip/eye ratio usually (78%, 28 of36) <span style="color: green;">.61 or more</span>  Differing from all others of the pau/soni subeomplex (as well as those of the carinata subcomplex) in usually having 34 or more anterior seale rows, 40 or more maximum scale rows, and 27 or more posterior seale rows| usually 13 or more supralabials, 14 or more infralabials| 3rd supralabial usually split on both sides| and usually supralabials 7-8, 7-8-9, or 8-9, entering orbit. (Smith et al. 1981: 298)Description of holotype (vindumi). A young, well preserved female with one short abdominal slit. Scale rows 34-43-28| keels present on all dorsal seales except in 1st and 2nd rows. Ventrals 187| anal entire, preeeded by apreanal as narrow as anal, narrower than adjaeent ventral| umbilicus on ventrals 145-7| subcaudals 39, the 1st divided but its halves in contact| an additional, terminal eaudal spine. Supralabials 14-14, 7th and 8th entering orbit on both sides| 14-15 infralabials| 12-13 circumorbitals, including a large preocular on each side and one small subpreocular on one side, two on the other| 3 postrostrals| 2 internasals| 2 scales between postrostrals and internasals| a minimum of 11 scales in a row between preoculars anterior to circumorbitals, 9 between orbits| 3-3 enlarged supraoculars, 2-2 entering orbit| 3 scales contacting nasal between postrostral and 2nd supralabial| 3rd and 4th supralabials split on both sides, as compared with 2nd| 3 prefrontals.

Ground colour, a light grey-brown, lighter on venter| a vertebral darker streak about four scales wide, with lateral extensions onto four or more scale rows on eaeh side, usually alternating so as to produee a somewhat zigzag pattern| under side of head mostly dark, of about same shade as top of head and the dark marks on body. Tail dark brown, almost black, sharply contrasted with body, its pattern an expansion of the dorsal pattern of body, but with equally dark blotches on lower surface separated from each other and from dorsal markings by irregular white areas. (Smith et al. 1981: 298)Variation (vindumi). See tables. Eleven females (of 26) exceeded the TTL of the largest male. Only 11 of the total of 37 examined were males. No specimens examined exhibited the striped morph that is so common in members of the carinata subcomplex, and occurs also in Candoia p. mcdowelli| all had a zigzag pattern much Iike the holotype. However, four had a very bright pattern because of a light, almost white ground colour and nearly black markings. The tail is distinctly darker than the body in all except the four brightly marked specimens, in which the body markings are about as dark as those on the tail. (Smith et al. 1981: 299)Comparisons (vindumi). Candoia p. vindumi is readily distinguished from the rest of the paulsoni subcomplex by its high number o f scale rows, as weil as bya few other characters. In 92% of C. p. vindumi the anterior scale rows are 34 or more (vs 11% in C. p. paulsoni, 0% in the other subspecies of C. paulsoni)| maximum scale rows 40 or more in 100% (vs 21 % in C. p. paulsoni, 0-5% in the other subspecies)| posterior scale rows 27 or more in 100% (vs 22% in C. p. paulsoni, 1-12% in the other subspecies). In addition, the supralabials are 13 or more in 96% of Candoia p. vindumi, 30% of C. p. paulsoni, and 2-13% in others of the subcomplex. Concomitantly, only the 7th and/or higher numbers of supralabials enter the orbit in 69% of C. p. vindumi, only 0-8% in the others. The 3rd supralabial is split on both sides in 81% of C. p. vindumi, in 54% of C. p. paulsoni and 0-16% of the rest. The infralabials are 14 or more in 91% of C. p. vindumi, in 48% of C. p.paulsoni, and in 4-33% of the others.

(Smith et al. 1981)Comparisons. Species other than those ofthe carinata complex have a more or less rounded snout, not flat and overhung, and the supralabials are separated from the orbit| in addition, in Candoia asper the  <span style="color: red;">subcaudals</span>  are in the tens or twenties, on a very short tail, and in C. bibronii the  <span style="color: red;">ventrals</span>  are 203 or more.Within the Candoia carinata complex, the distinct postanal white spot, docHe  <span style="color: red;">temperament</span>  ectotherm diet and small size are shared only with populations from the South Moluccas (topotypes of C. carinata, see Böhme et al., 1998), and their relatives in Sangihe, Irian Jaya and northern Papua New Guinea, almost invariably with keels on the 2nd scale row at least on neck. In all populations, the enlarged supraoculars are smaller, usually there is a minimum of 4 or more scales in a row between them, and usually 2 or more border the orbit. The  <span style="color: red;">anterior scale rows</span>  number 29 or more in 94% of the material from the Solomon Islands, 100% of Bougainville material, 82%. from Papua New Guinea, and 79% from Halmahera. Totallengths of900 mm or more, up to 1375 mm, are known from Halmahera, Bougainville and the Solomon Islands, the largest from the latter area. (Smith et al. 1981)Variation. See tables. Exceedingly polymorphie in colour and pattern in life, "with everything from lemon yellow to charcoal occurring, including bright brick red, and with striped, spotted or zigzag patterns, dull to brightly contrasted" (Crombie, pers. comm.). The striped individuals have a unique, irregular dorsolateral white line on each side (Fig. 5)| no other species of the carinata complex exhibits that variation in the striped phase.

(By loreals are here meant all the scales situated between the posterior nasals, the supralabials, the preorbitals, and the scales corresponding to the prefrontals, without reference to their origin| in the present case I think there are only two loreals proper, while the subloreal is only a detached portion of the fifth supralabials, and the supraloreal a part of the prefrontals.) (Stejneger 1889: 96)Description of type specimen. Rostral plate very prominent, recurved, pentagonal, its nasal border twice as long as its labial| eye surrounded by a ring of scales of nearly equal size, 10 on the right side, but only 9 on the left| between the posterior nasal and the middle preocular two large loreal scales, and under the posterior one, wedged in between it, the middle and lower prefrontals, and fourth, fifth, and sixth supralabials, a somewhat smaller subloreal| over the posterior loreal a superloreal of medium size| nasal divided, the anterior plate meeting the one of the other side| back of these a pair of' rather large anterior prefrontals followed by four smaller posterior prefrontals, or what corresponds to these plates where a frontal exists, the outer ones being larger than those in the middle| posterior to these the head is covered with numerous rather irregular scales| supralabials 13, the first four highest| infralabials 15, gradually diminishing in height from the pair joining the triangular mental| mental fissure separating four pairs of scales| scales of body smooth, in 33 to 35 longitudinal rows, the inferior on each side slightly larger than the rest| gasterosteges narrow. 232 | anal small, entire | tail short, blunt| urosteges 45, entire. (Stejneger 1889: 96)Dimensions: Total length, 870mm| length of tail from anus, 110mm| diameter of eye, 3mm| from tip of muzzle to anterior border of eye, 11mm| proportion of last two measurements=1: 3.7. (Stejneger 1889: 96)Coloration. Ground color light bluish gray, with a light brownish wash on the upper surface| three longitudinal ill defined, zigzag bands of a pale raw umber brown running the whole length of the body, the middle one starting between the eyes running to the end of the tail, the lateral ones starting on the temporal region becoming obscure on the tail| top of muzzle and occasional blotches between the bands of the same color| whole underside, except the gulars, mottled irregularly with blotches of a dark neutral tint. Of the forms which compose this genus the present species appears to be the most highly differentiated, the most distinctive feature being the elongation of the snout and the prominence and shape of the rostral. From the L. trivirgata, myriolepis, and simplex group, it differs more particularly by the low number of scale rows and loreals. In these respects it seems to agree very well with roseofusca, from which it differs in the greater number of scales composing the eye ring as well as in coloration. There may be other and more important distinctions, but not having seen a specimen of the latter species, I have to rely solely upon Professor Cope's original description, which is very meager indeed. A. specimen collected at San Diego, Cal., received from Miss Rosa Smith can not be identified with any of the other forms hitherto recognized though combining characters of some of them in such a manner as to make it probable that additional material will prove it to be only a subspecies of L. myriolepis. It may be characterized as L. simplex. (Stejneger 1889: 96)DIAGNOSIS (simplex). Scales in 40 rows| eye encircled by 7 or 8 scales| loreals 6| labials 13/15 | gasterosteges 232| anal entire| urosteges 39, entire. (Stejneger 1889: 96)Description of type specimen (simplex). Rostral plate as in the other species, except L. orcutti, pentagonal, its nasal border but slightly longer than its labial| eye surrounded by a ring of 8 scales (on the left side, but 7 only on the right side, the two posterior superorbitals having become fused) the anteorbital being very large| three true loreals, above which two smaller supraloreals| on the right side two rather large subloreals, being the detached upper portions of the fourth and fifth supralabials, while on the left side only part of the fifth is thus separated| nasal divided, the anterior portion meeting the one of the other side| posterior to these are two pairs of rather regular prefrontals followed by the usual small irregular frontal scales of the genus| supralabials 13, the first three (four) highest| infralibials 15| mental small, triangular, mental fissure separating four pairs of scales| scales of body smooth, hexagonal, imbricated, in 40 longitudinal rows, the lower one largest| gasterosteges 232: anal small, entire| urosteges 39, entire. (Stejneger 1889: 97)Dimensions (simplex). Total length, 765mm| length of tail, from anus, 80mm : diameter of eye, 2.5mm| from tip of muzzle to anterior border of eye, 10mm | proportion of last two measurements = 1:4. (Stejneger 1889: 98)Coloration (simplex). Uniform drab-brown above, fading into whitish on the under parts. In spite of the fewer scales forming the eye ring, a feature which seems to be of less importance, the present form appears to agree better with L. myriolepis than with roseofusca. The scale rows are only two less than in a specimen labeled L. myriolepis by Cope himself U.S. Nat. Mus., No. 14129| San Diego| Charles Orcutt, coll.), and in the numerous loreal scales it also agrees better with the latter. The diameter of the eye shows the same ratio to the distance from the tip of the muzzle in these two forms, thereby differing considerably from L. trivirgata, in which the eye is comparatively much larger. From L. or cutti the new form differs in the much less produced muzzle and rostral, in the number of scale rows, loreals, and scales composing the eye ring, in the still smaller eye, as well as in coloration.

Sanzinia volontany	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis: Sanzinia madagascariensis volontany differs from S. m. madagascariensis by a predominantly brownish adult colouration (predominantly greenish in S. m. m.) and a high genetic differentiation in the 16S rRNA gene (Tab. 1) which is nearly twice as high as between Acrantophis madagascariensis and A. dumerilii. Morphologically, there is a tendency of the new subspecies to have a lower number of infralabials, and possibly of supralabials and perioculars (see Tab. 3), but none of these characters can be used as a reliably diagnostic difference (Vences & Glaw 2003: 194)Description of the holotype: Specimen in good state of preservation, fixed in formalin and stored in 70 % ethanol| hemipenis everted| lateral cut present| tissue sample for DNA studies removed. <span style="color: red;">total length</span>  <span style="color: green;">143 cm</span>  counts and measurements are given in Tables 2 and 3. <span style="color: red;">head</span>  <span style="color: green;">narrow</span>  distinctly longer than wide| <span style="color: red;">rostral</span>  <span style="color: green;">more or less pentagonal</span>  slightly higher than wide| one pair of internasals| anal scale undivided. The colouration in life is shown in Figures 4b and 6. The ground colour is light brown, with  <span style="color: green;">32-34</span>  <span style="color: red;">dark brown markings</span>  of  <span style="color: red;">irregular shape</span>  on each side of the body ( <span style="color: green;">round, drop-like or triangular</span> ) which partly extend  <span style="color: red;">ventrally</span>  to contact the ventrals. In the posterior part of the body, the brown markings partly fuse in the vertebral region with each other, whereas they are generally not in contact in the anterior body part. Dorsally, the brown markings are bordered by a yellowish band which becomes broader and more distinct towards the vertebral region. In each dark marking, there is a yellowish marking of  <span style="color: red;">irregular shape</span> (triangular, round or elongated). The  <span style="color: red;">head</span>  is dorsally brown and largely unspotted (Fig. 6) and  <span style="color: red;">ventrally</span>  <span style="color: green;">whithish</span>  and unspotted. The ventral side of the body is whitish with numerous brownish spots which partly form irregular and interrupted dark bands. The  <span style="color: red;">subcaudal scales</span>  are  <span style="color: green;">largely brown</span>  The colouration in preservative (after about 20 months) appears virtually identical to that in life, perhaps slightly faded. The light borders and the light markings in the brown markings have become partly whitish.(Vences & Glaw 2003: 194)Variation: Based on the data of the seven specimens as given in Table 3, S. m. volontany is characterized by the following meristic values: 203-230 ventrals| 36-46 subcaudals| 39-50 dorsals| 12-15 supralabial scales (11-13 of them with distinct vertical furrow), any supralabial between the 7th and 10th can have contact with the eye| 13-15 infralabials (12-13 of them with distinct vertical furrow)| 7-13 periocular scales| 9-12 interocular scales (as defined in Tab. 3)| 2-3 loreal scales. Variation in colouration and patterns is shown in Figures 5 and 7 and described in Table 4. (Vences & Glaw 2003: 194)<br>

Chilabothrus argentum	Serpentes	Boidae	Definition. A species of Chilabothrus boid snake possessing the following characteristics: <span style="color: green;">silver to tan</span>  <span style="color: red;">dorsal background coloration</span>  with or without scattered dark brown scales, which appear either individually or in small clusters| a reduced to absent dorsal pattern consisting of faint light-gray elongate dorso- ventral blotching, occasionally no pattern is obvious| <span style="color: green;">pure cream-white</span>  <span style="color: red;">ventral scales</span> | a  <span style="color: green;">single</span>  <span style="color: red;">loreal scale</span> | ventral scale count ranging from 275 to 282| subcaudal scale count ranging from 82 to 91| a low number (11–12) of supralabials| 9–10 circumorbitals| <span style="color: green;">largely arboreal</span>  <span style="color: red;">substrate use</span> | <span style="color: red;">phylogenetic distinctiveness</span>  at mitochondrial locus CYTB consisting of  <span style="color: green;">> 3% pairwise divergence from other bahamian chilabothrus species</span>  (Reynolds et al. 2016)Comparisons: Chilabothrus argentum sp. nov. is similar in scale counts to C. chrysogaster, particularly to C. c. schwartzi, though C. chrysogaster generally has fewer ventrals (242–277 versus 275–282 in C. argentum) and more supralabials (12–16 versus 11–12 in C. argentum) and is quite variable in meristic characters and coloration across its range (Tolson and Henderson, 1993| Reynolds and Gerber, 2012). Chilabothrus c. relicquus is variable in coloration (Suppl. Fig. S1), and most specimens have some dorsal patterning and resemble other members of the species. Occasionally individuals of C. chrysogaster have reduced color patterns (Reynolds and Gerber, 2012), and one specimen of C. c. relicquus (KUH 260080| Suppl. Fig. S1) has a color pattern somewhat similar to C. argentum sp. nov., though this specimen has two loreals (like C. chrysogaster) and a higher number of supralabials (13 versus 11–12), preoculars (3 versus 1), and postocu- lars (5 versus 4), all similar to C. chrysogaster.

Eryx sistanensis	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis: Eryx sistanensis sp. nov. and E. johnii differ from other erycids by having the banding pattern on the tail, although this pattern is not always observed in the specimens of E. johnii (Boulenger 1893| Wall 1912| Smith 1943| Minton 1966| Leviton & Anderson 1970| Sorensen 1988| Das 1991| Sharma 2007). As Russell (1801) stated in the description of the type specimen of E. johnii: “the obtuse point of the tail resembles the head, and in point of thickness sometimes exceeds it.” In our specimens of the new species, the end of the tail is not as blunt as E. johnii and the thickness of the end of the tail is less than that of the head (Fig. 2). Despite the overlapping ranges in the pholidosis and morphometric characters of E. sistanensis sp. nov. and E. johnii, E. sistanensis sp. nov. differs from E. johnii by having fewer  <span style="color: red;">dorsal scale rows</span>  at midbody ( <span style="color: green;">43–56</span>  versus 47–67). (ESKANDARZADEH et al. 2020)Description of holotype (Fig. 3): A juvenile, body length 220 mm, and tail length 30 mm. The ratio of inter-ocular space width to distance between the posterior edge of the eye and the corner of the mouth 1.2. Head small, indistinct from the neck| eye small, on side of the head, bordered by 11 and 10 small scales on each side| six large scales between the eyes. Two elongated postinternasal scales| the first four rows of the scales immediately after the rostral arranged in a symmetric pattern. Three scales between the eye and nasal. Eleven supralabial scales| the second supralabial scale higher than the third. Dorsal surface of the body with small scales (DRS 43:43:38) <span style="color: red;">ventral scales</span>  <span style="color: green;">190</span>  wider than dorsal scales. <span style="color: red;">subcaudal scales</span>  <span style="color: green;">26</span>  The scales of the dorsal surface of tail slightly keeled. (ESKANDARZADEH et al. 2020)Coloration of holotype: The preserved specimen in alcohol has paler color than that in alive specimen. Dorsal ground color of the preserved specimen in alcohol was yellow with shadows of grey color. The banding pattern was obvious on the tail with three large dark spots| a very pale shadow of patched areas was observed over the dorsal surface of the trunk. The ventral surface was yellow. (ESKANDARZADEH et al. 2020)Variation in color: Pictures of two additional specimens from Rikukash in Sistan & Baluchistan Province (25.88N 61.68E) and near Shamil Village (27.5N 56.85E) in Hormozgan Province (Fig. 6) were also observed. These specimens had been photographed in farms by local people. In spite of the common banding pattern observed in all the studied and photographed specimens, they show different color patterns. HCHSU 8487 was grey in dorsal surface| the banding pattern along the body was more obvious than that in the holotype specimen. The head was black| ventral surface was cream with some black spots forming a narrow line in the middle of ventral surface| this line was discontinuous. The dorsal color of the specimens from Gurband was reddish brown| having large black patches on the dorsal surface| from tail to the head the patches were faint and irregular. Head with black shadow. The color pattern of the specimen from Shamil was similar to that from Gurband. The specimen from Rikukash has darker background color and the banding pattern is less obvious and less regular than the other specimens. (ESKANDARZADEH et al. 2020)<br>
<br>
Chilabothrus ampelophis	Serpentes	Boidae	Diagnosis: A small ( <span style="color: red;">maximum svl</span> = 697 mm) species of Chilabothrus (Figs. 2, 3) of slender habitus, with a distinctive neck, a dorsally flattened head and narrow snout, and eyes protruding dorsally above head level and directed anterolaterally. There is a distinctive head scutellation with either supraocular, frontal, and parietal (or altogether) scales highly fragmented into numerous small scales (Fig. 5)| a moderate to high ventral scale count, a high modal loreal scale count, high modal circumorbital count, and high modal labial counts. The dorsal ground coloration is of dark taupe to tan-brown with a dorsal pattern of dark brown to blackish helix (zigzag) composed of fused narrow diagonal blotches, also with squarish, nearly rectangular or X-shaped blotches running dorsally, with all markings irregularly outlined and bordered with pale cream or whitish cream scales that form highly contrasting stripes or spots. There is a dark brown lateral stripe (at times disrupted) that branches toward dorsolateral and lateroventral areas, forming a diffuse reticulated effect laterally.The new species somewhat resembles C. fordii, to which it is most closely related (Figs. 5–7) and to which a closer comparison is warranted. Chilabothrus ampelophis sp. nov. differs from C. fordii (Tables 1, 2) in having a higher number of ventral scales (263–273 vs. 231–263 in C. fordii), higher count of subcaudals (86–93 vs. 69–89 in C. fordii), and higher count of dorsal scale rows at midbody (38–40 vs. 31–39 in C. fordii). Other characters (clearly separable) are: multiple supraoculars (4/4–8/8 vs. a single platelike supraocular in C. fordii| Fig. 6), as well as multiscale intersupraoculars or short frontal (vs. a single and long, platelike frontal in C. fordii) that when single, the frontal covers less than the length of an eye (vs. frontal plate longer than or as long as the eyes in C. fordii), with frontal scale variation reflecting on a highly variable head-scale formula (to 4-4-4 in C. ampelophis, but modally 3-1-3 in C. fordii| Fig. 5). Small, multiple scales are in the first row of prefrontals (vs. large prefrontals basically arranged in three pairs in C. fordii), and very small scales are in the parietal region (vs. larger, at times platelike frontoparietals in C. fordii). There are high modal counts in: supralabials 15 (vs. 13 in C. fordii), infralabials 16 (vs. 14 in C. fordii), loreals 5 (vs. 2 in C. fordii), circumorbitals 16 (vs. 10 in C. fordii), infraloreals 2–4, mode 2 (vs. 0–2, mode 1 in C. fordii), and preoculars 2 (vs. 1 in C. fordii).The new species also differs in having a more distinctive neck (% NW/HW 50–53, x̅= 51 vs. 57–62, x̅ = 59 in C. fordii), a flatter head and snout (vs. convex frontal region and a tapered snout in C. fordii| Fig. 6), with orbits and supraoculars protruding over the level of the frontal region in profile view (vs. supraoculars below or not protruding over the frontal region in C. fordii| Fig. 6), a more attenuate snout (% IN/IO 42–46, x̅ = 45 vs. 49–63, x̅ = 53 in C. fordii), a slightly longer snout (% RO/HL 35–36, x̅ = 35 vs. 31–36, x̅ = 34 in C. fordii), and a wider interocular distance (% of IO/HL 31–35, x̅ = 33 vs. 25– 33, x̅ = 30 in C. fordii). Chilabothrus fordii has a maximum known SVL of  <span style="color: green;">860 mm</span> (Tolson and Henderson 1993), whereas the largest C. ampelophis sp. nov. we observed was 697 mm SVL. Lengths of the TAIL/SVL are moderately higher (22–25, x̅ = 24 vs. 20– 23, x̅ = 22 in C. fordii). The dorsal coloration (in life) of C. ampelophis sp. nov. differs in having a darker ground color (dark taupe to tan-brown vs. pale gray to ‘‘grayish tan’’ in C. fordii) and in the shape of the primary elements of the dorsal pattern of dark brown to blackish narrow blotches (one to three scales wide at mid-dorsum) diagonally arranged and fused to form a zigzag (Fig. 7)| some of the blotches consist of irregularly outlined bold Xs, squares, or rectangles, lined with pale cream scales (vs. pale milk-chocolate brown to medium brown ovate or subcircular blotches three to four scales wide and usually transverse, isolated, and lined with pale gray scales, but see Discussion)| <span style="color: red;">venter</span>  is pale cream to light gray sprinkled with darker gray and brown (vs. <span style="color: green;">white</span>  or dirty  <span style="color: green;">white</span>  with gray suffusions in C. fordii)| in preservative, the new species is nearly monochromatic with only ventral pale cream suffusions (vs. brown dorsal pattern and a light beige  <span style="color: red;">venter</span>  in C. fordii)| these two species have an allopatric distribution (Fig. 1| see Discussion).Chilabothrus ampelophis sp. nov. differs from another close relative, the also slender and small ( <span style="color: red;">maximum svl</span>  to 900 mm) C. gracilis, by the orbits and supraoculars protruding above the frontal region (vs. orbits and supraoculars not protruding above the frontal region in C. gracilis)| also by the longer head (% HL/SVL 3.0–4.0, x̅ = 3.4 vs. 2.4–2.7, x̅ = 2.5 in C. gracilis), longer snout (% NO/HL 27–28, x̅ = 27 vs. 23–25, x̅ = 24 in C. gracilis), much more attenuated snout (% IN/HL 14–15, x̅ = 15, IN/HW 26– 29, x̅ = 28, and IN/IO 42–46, x̅ = 45 vs. 18– 21,x̅ =19,31–36,x̅ =33,and49–55,x̅ =53, respectively), narrower neck (% NW/HW 50–53, x̅ =51 vs. 38–51, x̅ =44 in C. gracilis), and smaller eye (% OL/HL 15–18, x̅ = 17 vs. 18–21, x̅ = 20). There are also multiscale intersupraoculars or short frontal (vs. a single and long platelike frontal in C. gracilis), a lower count of ventrals (263–273 vs. 271–304 in C. gracilis), and lower count of subcaudals (86–93 vs. 90–111 in C. gracilis). It is further differentiated by the shape of the primary elements of dorsal pattern (dark brown to black zigzag, X-shaped, squarish, and rectangular blotches vs. ovate to subcircular dark brown body blotches)| their distributions are allopatric (see Discussion).From sympatric C. striatus, C. ampelophis sp. nov. differs in having a diminutive body size (maximum known SVL 697 mm vs. <span style="color: red;">maximum svl</span>  1,900 mm| Reynolds et al., 2016b), orbits and supraoculars protruding above the frontal region (vs. orbits and supraoculars not protruding above the frontal region in C. striatus), fewer ventrals (263– 273 vs. 266–299 in C. striatus), fewer dorsal scale rows at midbody (38–40, modally 38 vs. 35–65, modally 48 or more in C. striatus), infralabials modally 16 (vs. 18 or 19 in C. striatus), loreals modally 5 (vs. 1 or 2 in C. striatus). The shape of the primary elements of the dorsal pattern also differs (dark brown to black zigzag, and X-shaped, squarish, or rectangular blotches vs. 60–122 stripes or elongated blotches, often virtually patternless in C. striatus).<br>
