$Abronia anzuetoi	Diagnosis: “A species of Abronia having: (1) distinctive spinelike supra-auricular scales in subadults and adults; (2) unexpanded supranasals; (3) a median frontonasal scale; (4) posterior internasals relatively small, although about twice the length of anterior internasals; (5) discrete canthals; (6) two or three primary temporals, the lower two contacting the postoculars; (7) usually no parietal-median supraocular contact; (8) a single occipital; (9) posterolateral head scales not knoblike; (10) anterior superciliary contacting cantholoreal, similar in length to other scales in series; (11) posterior subocular broadly separated from the lower primary temporal by the penultimate supralabial, which is the posteriormost scale in this series to reach the orbit; (12) at least three rows of granular preauriculars; (13) postmental divided; (14) posterior infralabial elongate, often about twice as long as preceding infralabials; (15) six longitudinal nuchal scale rows; (16) 27-28 dorsal transverse scale rows; (17) 14 dorsal longitudinal scale rows arranged parallel to ventrolateral fold; (18) 14 ventral longitudinal scale rows; (19) adults dark green or dark blue-green (fig. 11C, D); and (20) juvenile pattern unknown. This species differs from all other species of Abronia that have spinelike supra-auricular scales, except A. aurita, A. gaiophantasma, A. lythrochila, and some A. matudai, in having 14 longitudinal ventral scale rows. Abronia anzuetoi differs from all other species of Abronia, except A. aurita, A. graminea, and A. smithi, in having a distinctly yellow circumorbital region. Abronia anzuetoi differs from A. aurita in coloration (dark emerald green or dark blue green versus a paler green with yellow and/or orange markings), in having relatively longer posterior internasals, and possibly in being of a larger body size (maximum known SVL 135 mm versus 125 mm). Abronia anzuetoi differs from A. gaiophantasma in having more numerous postoccipital rows between the occipital and first nuchal row (two or three versus one), expansion of the posterior infralabial, and in a green coloration with yellow eye region (versus a brown dorsum and circumorbital region not yellow), and from A. lythrochila in having a divided postmental (usually single in A. lythrochila), and in a green dorsal coloration with yellow orbit (color variable in A. lythrochila, but often brownish or with numerous black markings, never with yellow orbit).” (Campbell & Frost 1993: 23)

$Abronia aurita	Diagnosis: “A species of Abronia having: (1) distinctive spinelike supra-auricular scales in subadults and adults; (2) unexpanded supranasals; (3) a median frontonasal scale, usually not contacting frontal; (4) posterior internasals not greatly enlarged; (5) discrete canthals; (6) 2-5 (usually 3) primary temporals, the lower two contacting the postoculars; (7) usually no parietal-median supraocular contact; (8) a single occipital; (9) posterolateral head scales not knoblike; (10) anterior superciliary contacting cantholoreal, similar in length to other scales in series; (11) the posterior subocular broadly separated from the lower primary temporal by the penultimate supralabial, which is the posteriormost scale in this series to reach the orbit; (12) preauricular scales small, granular, elevated, usually disposed in 3-4 rows; (13) postmental variable, but most frequently single; (14) the posteriormost infralabial elongate, often about twice as long as preceding infralabials; (15) usually six longitudinal nuchal scale rows; (16) 27-31 dorsal transverse scale rows; (17) 14 dorsal longitudinal scale rows, these parallel to ventrolateral fold; (18) 14 ventral longitudinal scale rows; (19) adult greenish dorsal coloration with much black mottling concentrated into indistinct dorsal crossbands; (20) juvenile pattern of dark dorsal crossbands. This species differs from all other species of Abronia that have protuberant supra-auricular scales, except A. anzuetoi (fig. 11C, D), A. gaiophantasma (fig. 11A, B), some A. matudai, and A. lythrochila (fig. 11F), in having 14 longitudinal ventral scale rows. Abronia aurita differs from all other species of Abronia except A. graminea, A. anzuetoi, and A. smithi (fig. 11E) in having a distinctly yellow orbital region. Abronia aurita differs from A. anzuetoi in coloration (relatively pale green or yellow-green with yellow and/or orange markings versus dark emerald green or dark blue green), in having comparatively shorter posterior internasals, and being of a smaller size (maximum SVL 125 versus 135 mm). Abronia aurita differs from A. gaiophantasma in having more numerous postoccipital rows between the occipital and first nuchal row (two or three versus one), having multiple rows of nonimbricate preauriculars (versus two or fewer subimbricate rows), having an expanded posterior infralabial, the parietal usually in contact with the median supraoculars (not so in A. gaiophantasma), and features of color pattern. Abronia aurita differs from most specimens of A. lythrochila in having discrete canthals (versus canthals usually fused with posterior internasals) and in having a distinctly yellow circumorbital region.” (Campbell & Frost 1993: 13 and Table 1).

$Abronia deppii	Diagnosis (genus): Abronia can be distinguished from all other gerrhonotines(Coloptychon, Gerrhonotus, Barisia, Elgaria, and Mesaspis) in the combination of having: (1) the fifth row of temporal scales absent (except, probably anomalously,on one side of one specimen of A. salvadorensis) (present in all other genera); (2)large, well-clawed limbs (smaller limbs in all other genera); and (3) a reduced lateral fold (much better developed in all other genera),particularly between the anterior limb and ear (Campbell & Frost 1993: 98). Diagnosis: This species has (1) the supraauricular scales weakly developed knob-like, having no indication of spines; (2) supranasals not expanded and not in contact at dorsal midline; (3) frontonasal usually in contact with frontal; (4) posterior internasals almost twice as long as anterior internasals (1.8); (5) no canthals;(6) three anterior temporals in each side; (7) parietal separated from supraoculars; (8) single occipital; (9) posterior head scales weakly developed knob-like; (10) anterior supercilliary not contacting the cantholoreal; (11) posterior suboccular separated from the lower primary temporal by the penultimate scale in the supralabial series; (12) preauricular scales slightly enlarged and in one row;(13) two postmentals; (14) posterior infralabials elongated; (15) preauricular scales slightly enlarged; (16) six longitudinal nuchal scale rows; (17) 24-28 transversal dorsal scale rows; (18) 10-12 longitudinal dorsal scale rows; (19) 12-14 longitudinal ventral scale rows; (20) six, sometimes seven, dark dorsal bands. Abronia deppii can be distinguished from the Guerrero population by weakly developed knob-like posterior head scales (Fig. 2); lower anterior temporal in broad contact with antepenultimate supralabial; azygous scale between interparietal and occipital frequently present (about 60% of cases); head width <22 mm in adult males and <18 in adult females; ratio of head width to head length <0.75 in adult males; scale whorls on tail 68-80 (x = 77); infralabial scales 7-8; preauricular scales only slightly enlarged; longitudinal dorsal scale rows 10-11; dorsum with well defined bold black crossbands, confluent and more or less symmetrical on vertebral region; dorsal head coloration with pattern of black and white irregular blotches; ventral color in adult males tends to be reddish, occasionally bright red; upper lips marked with black. Differs from other species of the subgenus Abronia (sensu Campbell and Frost, 1993) by having oblique longitudinal rows of dorsal scales, where fuscolabialis, taeniata, and graminea have parallel longitudinal scale rows,where taeniata and graminea do not; has one lowertemporal contacting postoccular series; and a single occipital, where mixteca and oaxacae have three occipitals and two primary temporals contacting postocular series; has body coloration that it is not uniformly green, where graminea is; has six nuchals, where graminea has four (only juveniles of graminea have bands on the dorsum of the body). (from Flores-Villela & Sánchez 2003: 525)

$Abronia fimbriata	Diagnosis: “One of the most distinctive species of Abronia, having: (1) distinctive spinelike supra-auricular scales in subadults and adults; (2) expanded supranasals meeting at midline; (3) frontonasal absent; (4) posterior internasals relatively large through fusion with canthals; (5) no discrete canthals, these apparently fused with posterior internasals; (6) two or three (most frequently two [anomalous fourth on one side of the lectotype]) primary temporals, the lower two contacting postoculars; (7) parietals usually in contact with the median supraoculars; (8) a single occipital; (9) posterolateral head scales not knoblike; (10) anterior superciliary contacting cantholoreal, similar in length to other scales in series; (11) posterior subocular in contact with the lower primary temporal or narrowly separated by the penultimate supralabial, which is the posteriormost scale in this series to reach the orbit; (12) preauricular scales small but not protuberant, disposed in 2-3 rows; (13) postmental single; (14) posterior infralabial not elongate; (15) six longitudinal nuchal scale rows; (16) 27-30 dorsal transverse scale rows; (17) 14 dorsal longitudinal scale rows arranged parallel to ventrolateral fold; (18) usually 12 (infrequently 14) ventral longitudinal scale rows, lateral row expanded; (19) mature adult dorsal coloration brown with much black mottling (fine vermiculation) concentrated dorsally (fig. 10D); (20) juvenile pattern of a broad pale brown middorsal stripe; subadults and young adults with brown chevron-shaped crossbands (figs. 10E, F). Abronia fimbriata consistently lacks the median frontonasal scale (figs. 6, 52); the only other species to do so (variably) are A. oaxacae (fig. 12F), in which a frontonasal is present in more than half of the known individuals, A. taeniata, in which a frontonasal is rarely absent, A. lythrochila (fig. 11F), in which one of eight specimens that we have examined lacks a frontonasal, and IBUNAM 340, which was previous identified as Gerrhonotus fimbriatus by Martín del Campo (1939) and as Abronia ochoterenai by Hartweg and Tihen (1946), Then (1954), and Casas-Andreu and Smith (*1990" [1991]). We have re-examined this specimen (IBUNAM 340) and find it to represent an undescribed species (see A. leurolepis account, following). The body of A. fimbriata (fig. 10D) is relatively elongate compared with A. aurita (fig. 10A), A. anzuetoi (fig. 11C), A. ochoterenai (fig. 14), A. leurolepis (fig. 17), and A. lythrochila (fig. 11F). This species differs from all other Abronia having spinelike supra-auricular scales, except for A. smithi, A. ochoterenai, A. leurolepis, and some A. matudai, in usually having 12 longitudinal ventral scale rows, with the lateral rows expanded. Abronia fimbriata is distinctive from these species in lacking both a frontonasal and discrete canthal scales. Other than A. fimbriata, only A. ornelasi and A. reidi exhibit large expanded supranasals that meet at the midline. In some specimens of A. matudai, the only known specimen of A. mitchelli, and one example of A. salvadorensis, the supranasals are expanded part way across the dorsum of the snout, but do not meet at the midline. All of these species lack spinelike supra-auricular scales. (Campbell & Frost 1993: 16) VARIATION: Campbell & Frost 1993: 18

$Abronia gaiophantasma	Diagnosis: “A species of Abronia having: (1) supra-auricular scales of subadults and adults spinelike; (2) supranasals relatively small and unexpanded, not in contact at the dorsal midline; (3) frontonasal scale present, not contacting frontal; (4) posterior internasals relatively small, only slightly larger than the anterior internasals; (5) canthals discrete; (6) three or four anterior temporals per side, usually the lower two (rarely one) contacting the postoculars; (7) parietal not in contact with median supraoculars; (8) usually a single occipital; (9) posterolateral head scales not knoblike; (10) anterior superciliary contacting cantholoreal, similar in length to other scales in series; (11) posterior subocular broadly separated from the lower primary temporal by the penultimate supralabial, the posteriormost scale in this series to reach the orbit; (12) two or occasionally three incomplete rows of subimbricate preauricular scales; (13) postmental single or divided; (14) posteriormost infralabial not elongate; (15) six longitudinal nuchal scale rows; (16) 28-30 dorsal transverse scale rows; (17) 12 dorsal longitudinal scale rows, arranged parallel to ventrolateral fold; (18) 14-16 ventral longitudinal scale rows; (19) adults tan, brown, gray-brown, or reddish brown (fig. 11A); (20) juveniles and subadults with dark brown crossbands (fig. 11 B). This species differs from other species of Abronia occurring east of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in having 12 (versus 14 or more) dorsal longitudinal scale rows. Abronia gaiophantasma (fig. 11A, B) differs from all Nuclear Central American species, except A. salvadorensis, A. matudai females, and some individuals of A. lythrochila in having an essentially brown dorsal coloration, with or without dark crossbands. Abronia gaiophantasma differs from A. salvadorensis in lacking a fourth row of temporal scales, having distinct supra-auricular spines; from A. matudai in having unexpanded supranasals, in usually having 3-4 anterior temporals (versus usually 2), in having 14-16 ventral longitudinal scale rows (versus 12), iN having distinct supraauricular spinelike scales, and in lacking contact between the parietals and the median supraoculars; and from A. lythrochila in having smaller lateral neck scales, having larger scales in the temporal region, lacking multiple rows of granular preauriculars, and lacking red pigment on the upper edge of the infralabials.” (Campbell & Frost 1993: 20) VARIATION: Campbell & Frost 1993: 21

$Abronia leurolepis	Diagnosis: “A species of Abronia having: (1) distinctive spinelike supra-auricular scales in adults; (2) unexpanded supranasals; (3) no median frontonasal scale; (4) posterior internasals not greatly enlarged, in the only known specimen the one on the right fused with the canthal; (5) canthals meeting at the midline, the left discrete, the right fused with the posterior internasal; (6) three primary temporals, the lower two contacting the postoculars; (7) narrow parietal-median supraocular contact on one side in the only known specimen; (8) a single large occipital; (9) posterolateral head scales not knoblike; (10) anterior superciliary contacting cantholoreal; (11) posterior subocular broadly separated from the lower primary temporal by the antepenultimate supralabial, the posteriormost scale in this series to reach the orbit; (12) preauricular scales small, nonimbricate and in three rows; (13) postmental single; (14) posteriormost infralabial elongate; (15) six longitudinal nuchal scale rows; (16) 31 dorsal transverse scale rows; (17) 14 dorsal longitudinal scale rows arranged parallel to ventrolateral fold; (18) 12 ventral longitudinal scale rows; (19) adult dorsal ground coloration unknown, but with dorsal crossbands; and (20) juvenile color pattern unknown. This species differs from all other species of Abronia having spinelike supra-auricular scales, except for A. smithi, A. ochoterenai, and A. fimbriata (variably), in having 12 longitudinal ventral scale rows, with the lateral rows expanded compared with adjacent ventral rows. Abronia leurolepis differs from all members of the Abronia aurita group except A. fimbriata and A. lythrochila (variably) in lacking a frontonasal scale. Abronia leurolepis differs from A. fimbriata in lacking expanded supranasals that meet at the dorsal midline, in having more dorsal transverse scale rows (31 versus 27-30), and in being a stockier animal. Abronia leurolepis differs from A. lythrochila in lacking a frontonasal (usually present in A. lythrochila), in having a single a scale row between the occipital and first nuchal scale row, in having 12 versus 14 ventral longitudinal scale rows, and in having more (31 versus 28-30) dorsal transverse scale rows. Abronia leurolepis differs from A. ochoterenai in having a single (rather than two) postoccipital row between the occipital and first transverse nuchal scale row and in having no contact between the subocular and lower primary temporal (broad contact in A. ochoterenai). Abronia leurolepis differs from all members of the A. aurita group in having almost flat dorsal scales, with only slight traces of keeling on 3-4 scale rows on either side of the midline. The lateral longitudinal row of ventral scales are expanded in this species as they are in all members of the A. aurita group having 12 ventral longitudinal scale rows. However, the posterior (free) edges of the expanded scales in A. leurolepis are obtusely pointed, whereas in other species of the A. aurita group having 12 ventral longitudinal rows the posterior edges of these scales are rounded to truncate. The occipital scale is large in A. leurolepis as are the scales immediately behind it; thus, only a single scale lies between the occipital and first transverse nuchal scale row, a character shared in the A. aurita group only with A. gaiophantasma.” (Campbell & Frost 1993: 35)

$Abronia matudai	Diagnosis: “A species of Abronia having: (1) supra-auricular scales of adults and subadults protuberant, but not spinelike; (2) supranasals large and often expanded, extending partially across the top of the snout, but not contacting each other at the dorsal midline; (3) a relatively large frontonasal scale, not contacting frontal; (4) posterior internasals relatively small, nearly the same size as the anterior internasals (except on one side of the holotype); (5) discrete canthals; (6) usually two anterior temporals per side, occasionally three or four; (7) parietal contacting median supraoculars; (8) a single occipital scale; (9) posterolateral head scales not knoblike; (10) anterior superciliary contacting cantholoreal, longer than other scales in series; (11) the posterior subocular separated from the lower primary temporal by the antepenultimate or occasionally the penultimate supralabial, the posteriormost scale in this series to reach the orbit; (12) two rows of subimbricate to granular preauricular scales; (13) postmental single or divided; (14) posteriormost infralabial not elongate; (15) six longitudinal nuchal scale rows; (16) 33-37 dorsal transverse scale rows; (17) 14-16 dorsal longitudinal scale rows, arranged parallel to ventrolateral fold; (18) 12-14 ventral longitudinal scale rows; (19) adult males green, females brown; (20) juvenile pattern unknown. This species differs from all species of Abronia east of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, except A. ornelasi, A. bogerti, A. montecristoi, and A. salvadorensis, in lacking distinctive spinelike supra-auriculars, although adults have relatively short but protuberant supraauricular scales. Abronia matudai differs from all Nuclear Central American species, except A. fimbriata, A. bogerti, and some individuals of A. aurita, in having the parietal contact the median supraoculars. Abronia matudai differs from A. ornelasi in having supranasals that do not contact each other at the dorsal midline and in having a frontonasal that does not contact the frontal; from A. montecristoi and A. salvadorensis in having more (33-37 versus 28 and 31-32 respectively) dorsal transverse scale rows; from A. fimbriata in having supranasals that do not meet at the dorsal midline and in having a frontonasal; from A. bogerti in usually having a minimum of six (versus eight) nuchals across the nape and 33-37 (versus 40) dorsal transverse scale rows; and from A. aurita in having more dorsal transverse scale rows (33-37 versus 27-31) and in lacking distinctive spinelike supraauricular scales.” (Campbell & Frost 1993: 38) Variation: Campbell & Frost 1993: 38

$Abronia meledona	Diagnosis: A species of Abronia in which (1) the distinctive supra-auricular scales of adults are protuberanat and spinelike; (2)supranasals are small and unexpanded, not in contact at dorsal midline; (3) median frontonasal scale present,usually not contacting frontal; (4) posterior internasals not greatly enlarged; (5) canthals discrete; (6) 2-3 anterior temporals per side; if two, both contacting the postoculars; if three, lower two contacting postoculars and upperscale relatively small and variably in contact with parietal; (7) parietal usually contacting median supraoculars, but in individuals having three anterior temporals per side, the upper temporal scale intervenes to partially or completely separate the parietal from the median supraocular series; (8) occipital single; (9) posterior head scales of adults not strongly convex or knoblike; (10) anterior superciliary contacting cantholoreal, similar in length to other scales in series; (11) posterior subocular broadly separated from the lower primary temporal by the penultimate supralabial, the posteriormost scale in this series to reach the orbit; (12) granular preauricular scales in about three rows; (13) postmental single; (14) posterior infralabial elongate, usually about twice as long as preceding infralabials; (15) longitudinal nuchal scales in six rows; (16) dorsal scales in 27-32 transverse rows; (17) dorsal scales in 14 (rarely 12) longitudinal scale rows, arranged parallel relative to ventrolateral fold; (18) ventral scales in 14 longitudinal rows; (19) dorsum of adults green or cream-colored with heavy black mottling (Fig. 1); (20) subadults bronze with black spots arranged in irregular transverse series across dorsum. The characters in the standard diagnosis given above will serve to distinguish this species from most other species of Abronia, exclusive of some members of the aurita subgroup. Members of this subgroup are similar to each other morphologically, but can be distinguished by their unique color patterns and by a combination of morphological features (Table 1). In contrast to the pinkish cream or green dorsal coloration that is very heavily mottled with black in A. meledona, the dorsum is paler green with less black mottling in A. aurita and A. vasconcelosii, deep emerald green with the posterior edges of the scales yellow-green in A. anzuetoi, and some shade of brown with moderate dark mottling in A. campbelli. Adult males of A. aurita and A. vasconcelosii usually have distinctive orange spots on their heads, whereas these spots are absent or poorly developed in A. meledona; if present, they are restricted to about the posterior third of individual scales in the temporal region. Orange spots are absent in A. anzuetoi and A. campbelli. The circumorbital region and supra-auricular spines are bright yellow in all species except A. campbelli, in which these areas are whitish or pale tan. Abronia vasconcelosii most frequently has 11 supralabials, whereas the other species have a modal number of 10. Some characters appear to vary somewhat clinically from east to west (exclusive of A. aurita, which occurs well to the north of the southern highlands where the other species occur). The lower tertiary temporal scale makes broad contact with the second primary temporal (thus, the lower scales of the primary and tertiary series of temporals are also in contact) with a frequency of 76% in A. campbelli, 37% in A. meledona, 50% in A. anzuetoi, 3% in A. vasconcelosii and 0% in A. aurita. The modal number of transverse dorsal and ventral scale rows, respectively, are 31 and 34 in A. campbelli, 28 and 35 for A. meledona, 28 and 36 for A. anzuetoi, and 29 and 36 for A. aurita and A. vasconcelosii.

$Abronia smithi	Diagnosis: “A species of Abronia having: (1) distinctive spinelike supra-auricular scales in subadults and adults; (2) unexpanded supranasals; (3) a median frontonasal scale, not contacting frontal; (4) posterior internasals not greatly enlarged; (5) discrete canthals; (6) usually four primary temporals, usually the lower two (rarely three) contacting the postoculars; (7) no parietalmedian supraocular contact; (8) a single occipital; (9) posterolateral head scales not knoblike; (10) anterior superciliary contacting cantholoreal or not; (11) the posterior subocular broadly separated from the lower primary temporal by the penultimate or antepenultimate supralabial, the posteriormost scale in this series to reach the orbit; (12) preauricular scales relatively small, usually disposed in two rows, usually imbricate or subimbricate; (13) postmental divided or single; (14) posterior infralabial not elongate; (15) six longitudinal nuchal scale rows; (16) 27-30 dorsal transverse scale rows; (17) 14 dorsal longitudinal scale rows arranged parallel to ventrolateral fold; (18) 12 ventral longitudinal scale rows; (19) adult dorsal coloration greenish (fig. 11E); (20) juvenile pattern with a broad pale brown middorsal stripe. This species differs from all other species of Abronia having spinelike supra-auricular scales, except for A. ochoterenai, A. matudai (variably), A. leurolepis, and A. fimbriata, in having 12 longitudinal ventral scale rows, and having the lateralmost rows wider than adjacent ventral rows. Abronia smithi differs from A. fimbriata and A. leurolepis in having a frontonasal scale, from A. leurolepis in having imbricate or subimbricate preauricular scales rather than multiple rows of protuberant scales, relatively short posteriormost infralabial, and definite keels on the body scales; from A. fimbriata in having unexpanded supranasals and discrete canthals; and from A. matudai in having four primary temporals (usually two, rarely three or four in A. matudai), no parietalmedian supraocular contact, and in lacking expanded supranasals. Abronia smithi appears to be most similar morphologically to A. ochoterenai, but differs from that species in having usually four or five, rather than three, primary temporals, usually having a fourth temporal scale row in evidence (clearly absent in A. ochoterenai), having the subocular separated from the lower primary temporal (broadly in contact in A. ochoterenai), usually having a divided rather than single postmental, having two or fewer rows of imbricate to subimbricate preauriculars rather than three rows of nonimbricate preauriculars, and in that adult females are yellow-green with darker spotting, rather than with dark transverse bands, and in having the circumorbital region bright yellow in A. smithi, not the ambient head color as in A. ochoterenai.” Campbell & Frost 1993: 30. Variation: Campbell & Frost 1993: 34.

$Acrochordus arafurae	Diagnosis (see also key to species of Acrochordus above). Differing from other species of Acrochordus in each of the following features: 1) nasal bones fused anteriorly; 2) hemipenis forked only at extreme tip, without spines or papillae; 3) pattern with intricate network of dark markings that are connected with one another but isolate spots of the brown or tawny ground colour. Additionally differing from A. javanicus (but resembling A. granulatus) in 1) absence of coronoid process on lower jaw; 2) posterior dentary teeth resembling other teeth in form; 3) scales of sides with one main cusp, flanked by much smaller cusps; 4) nasal bones tapering to a median anterior point; 5) maxillary teeth fewer (16-19); 6) dentary teeth fewer (13-17). Additionally differing from A. granulatus (but resembling A. javanicus) in: 1) nostrils directed forward, without upward inclination, separated from eye by 11-14 scales (against 5-7); 2) scales of lips less enlarged, with more rows (8-11, against 5-7) between eye and edge of lip; 3) long pterygoid row of 11-16 (against 5-7) teeth; 4) no transversely enlarged scale behind nasal; 5) less compressed tail, its vertical diametre much less than twice its horizontal diametre. (The hemipenial characters of this diagnosis checked on all males of material listed above; external, osteological, and dental characters checked on all material listed above, except nasal bones not checked for MCZ 118668, 118669, 118765, and 129121. In addition, vertebrae in region of heart checked on AMNH 86182 [Borroloola, Northern Territory] and found to have short neural spine confined to posterior edge of neural arch, essentially as in A. granulatus but unlike the high neural spine that arises from most of the length of the neural arch in A. javanicus and the Miocene-Pliocene A. dehmi Hoffstetter [1964] ).

Nostrils directed forward, near tip of snout, each nostril surrounded by circular nasal scute that forms a narrow rim; nasal scutes separated from each other by a granular scale at their closest approximation; nasal-eye scales 11-14 (13 bilaterally in holotype; for total of left and right, range 22-28, mean 24.5, s = 1.91, sy = 0.39, N = 24); eye-eye scales = 17-21 (holotype with 18; mode 19; mean = 18.7, § = 1.12, sx̅ 0.23, N = 24); eye-lip scales 8-11 (11 left, 10 right in holotype; for sum of left and right, range 16-22, mean = 19.0 S = 1.49, sx̅ = 0.03, N = 24); no enlarged scales on dorsal aspect of head, the scales behind nasal small, granular; supralabials only slightly enlarged, 28-36 (35 bilaterally in holotype; for sum of left and right, range 54-70, mean = 61.25, s = 5.03, s = 1.45, N = 12); infralabials 23-30 (25 left, 24 right in holotype; for sum of left and right, range 47-57; mean = 51.3, = 3.50, sx̅ = 1.01, N = 12); corner of mouth concealed from lateral view by rictal fold, thus defining a scale-lined pocket at corner of mouth; rostral and mental scutes barely visible externally, but extending within mouth as distinct cornifications; middle of lower lip produced forward as a median lobe fitting closely into median notch of upper lip; no mental groove defined by modified scales or median depression. Scales of body juxtaposed, for most part not exposing any granular areas between them; on sides, each scale with prominent conical central cusp that extends backward past margin of base of scale, flanked by a more dorsal and a more ventral cusp, each much less developed than central cusp and often poorly defined; along back, central cusp less prominent, but along midline of belly the central cusp more developed, So that a median belly fold with 3 or 4 longitudinal scale rows is at least suggested; scales at midbody 120-178 (166 in holotype; mean = 147.7, S = 16.32, sx̅ =4.71, N = 12). No anal scute, the cloacal region U-shaped, the arms of the U directed backward as a pair of pockets into which anal glands open and which are continued backward within tail by hemipenes of males; lining of cloaca with granular scales near cloacal lips (AMNH 59886 and MCZ 118765, adult females, preserved with cloaca protruded as scaly tube that expands distally, the lateral pockets being completely everted; this perhaps an artifact of preservation, but probably possible during life, at least for females, thus explaining the extension of scaly skin within lining of cloaca and the deep lateral pockets of cloaca); tail nearly round in cross-section, about 13-20 percent of total length [since most of my specimens are either skinned out between neck and cloaca or else hardened in coils, only general order of magnitude can be determined]. (McDowell 1979: 76) Teeth: Maxillary teeth 16-19 (mode 18; mean = 17.6, S = 0.95; Sy 0.18, N = 29; counts by Stimson of 5 British Museum specimens included), shortest posteriorly, but because of downward curvature of rear of maxilla, tips of all teeth lying virtually on a straight line; palatine teeth 8-10 (mode 9; mean = 9.0, s = 0.42, Sy = 0.09, N = 24); pterygoid teeth 11-16 (mode 15; mean = 13.7, s = 1.33, S% = 0.27, N = 24); palatine-pterygoid teeth gradually diminish ing in length from before backward, last palatine tooth subequal to first pterygoid; last pterygoid tooth beneath pterygoid-ectopterygoid articulation; dentary teeth 13-17 (mode 17; mean = 15.75, 5 = 1.15, S = 0.24, N = 24), longest anteriorly (except for first 1 or 2), the most posterior similar in form to the other teeth. Compound bone of lower jaw without coronoid process, unless this process is represented by a triangular dorsolateral projection located near quadrate articulation; at least in holotype, dentary with two mental foramina (as in A. javanicus) but splenial of simple triangular form without anterodorsal notch (thus, as in A. granulatus); ectopterygoid smoothly arched, not dilated except at its articulations with maxilla and pterygoid; nasal bones fused anteriorly to form pointed median anterior process, suturally distinct posteriorly; at least in holotype, nasals and septomaxillae not in contact with frontal, and frontal-prefrontal contact confined to region dorsal to lachrymal foramen. (McDowell 1979: 76) Hemipenis of holotype 56 mm long, forked for the terminal 3 mm; sulcus spermaticus forked at forking of organ, with prominent lips that have well defined absulcal edges; lips of forked portion of sulcus expanded into pair of smooth pallets; no spines or papillae, but longitudinal folds, one of which fuses proximally with medial lip of sulcus. In AMNH 86183 (Borroloola, Northern Territory), preserved with both hemipenes incompletely everted, organ similar to that of holotype, directed downward and distinctly craniad (as in Colubroidea; in Booidea the everted organ points caudad), narrow and loosely helical. For 5 adult males, hemipenial length 29.0-63.7 mm (mean = 50.5 mm), forked portion 1.5-3.6 mm (mean = 2.6 mm), not significantly correlated with total length (r = 0.589, not significant for 3 degrees of freedom); length of furcation, in percent of total length: 3.7-8.6 (Stimson, pers. comm. finds the organ forked for 5 percent of its length in a British Museum specimen from Mimika River, Irian Jaya). (McDowell 1979: 76) Pattern of juvenile (BBM 3092): Lips yellow, with dark spotting at tip of muzzle; top of head brownish black with pale tawny postocular oval and tawny mottling on crown, condensed to a tawny blotch on dorsal side of muzzle; body tawny fading to yellowish white on belly, with black reticulations that take up less area than ground colour anteriorly, but pre dominate on rear of body and tail; underside of tail black with yellow spots; roof of mouth be tween palatines and floor of mouth (except median region from larynx forward) dark brown; tongue grey, fading to white on tips. This pattern retained in adults (including holotype), but ground colour darkens with age to dark olive, reducing contrast with black reticulations and pattern becomes incon spicuous, even on head. (McDowell 1979: 76)

Comparisons. Hebius modestus differs from the group of H. venningi, i.e., H. venningi, H. taronensis and H. nigriventer, with which it might be sympatric in northern India and Myanmar (Kachin State) by (1) the number of 19 DSR at midbody; (2) the general dorsal pattern, usually striped and with dark blotches above and below the dorsolateral stripe vs. not striped but chequered or, in H. nigriventer, with conspicuous, large dorsolateral blotches; (3) venter usually widely pale along its whole length, edged with blackish-brown, rarely entirely dark except on its most anterior part vs. (a) venter pale (coral red in life) mesially, on the anterior part of the body and dark, clouded posteriorly in H. venningi; (b) venter both pale and dark, i.e. with a pale background on its anterior part with irregular dark crossbands and nearly uniform on its posterior part in H. taronensis and (c) venter nearly entirely very dark in H. nigriventer; and (4) a conspicuous yellow streak on the sides of the neck (David et al. 2021).
