Antaresia maculosa	Serpentes	Pythonidae	Diagnosis: The clade found in our analyses that we call maculosa b. It differs from Antaresia perthensis by having highly contrasted  <span style="color: green;">large</span> dark blotches with usually  <span style="color: green;">ragged edges</span> along the body (vs less contrasted blotches and dots), a larger  <span style="color: red;">body size</span> (max. SVL  <span style="color: green;">1220 mm</span> vs 670 mm) and a higher number of  <span style="color: red;">ventrals</span> (249–280 vs 213–247). It differs from A. childreni by having a  <span style="color: red;">blotched pattern</span> (vs. being patternless) or by lacking a space between the blotches in the anterior third of the body creating a lateral pale stripe and by generally having more  <span style="color: green;">ragged edges</span> on its blotches. There are no consistent morphological diagnostic characters to differentiate it from the subspecies in Cape York, but it can be differentiated from it by various nucleotide substitutions in the cyt-b gene (see Table S7). From the species in the Torres Strait and New Guinea it is differentiated by having larger and more contrasting blotches (vs smaller scattered dots), and by never having less than  <span style="color: green;">four</span>  <span style="color: red;">prefrontal scales</span> (vs. sometimes having  <span style="color: green;">two</span> or three prefrontals) (Esquerré et al. 2021). Description. A small python, with a maximum recorded SVL of  <span style="color: green;">1220 mm</span>  Maximum recorded tail length is 112 mm and tail length is on average is 0.094 of the SVL. <span style="color: red;">head length</span> is on average 0.036 of the SVL, and it is on average  <span style="color: green;">1.68 times</span> the  <span style="color: red;">head width</span>  Maximum recorded  <span style="color: red;">mid-body girth</span> is  <span style="color: green;">140 mm</span>  and it is on average  <span style="color: green;">2.04 times</span> thicker than the  <span style="color: red;">neck</span>  <span style="color: red;">head scalation</span> comprises  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">large</span> symmetrical shields</span>  One  <span style="color: green;">large</span> roughly hexagonal or pentagonal  <span style="color: red;">frontal scale</span>  divided into  <span style="color: green;">two</span> scales longitudinally in some specimens. <span style="color: green;">two</span> <span style="color: red;">parietal scales</span> directly in contact with the frontal, posterior to which scales are largely undifferentiated. Parietals usually in contact but sometimes small scales are formed between them or between them and the frontal. One  <span style="color: green;">large</span>  <span style="color: red;">supraocular</span> above each eye. <span style="color: green;">four</span> <span style="color: green;">large</span>  <span style="color: red;">prefrontal scales</span>  with sometimes one additional small scale between them. <span style="color: green;">two</span>  <span style="color: red;">internasal scales</span>  <span style="color: red;">rostral scale</span> <span style="color: green;">in contact with internasals, nasal and first supralabials</span>  There are 9–12  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span> with an average of 10.5 |  and 11–14  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span> with an average of 12.9. <span style="color: green;">three to four</span> of the  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span> have conspicuous  <span style="color: red;">heat pits</span>  There is a single  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">large</span>  anteriorly pointed</span>  <span style="color: red;">preocular scale</span>  with an additional much smaller one between it and the fourth and/or fifth supralabial scales. There are 1–11 irregularly sized  <span style="color: red;">loreal scales</span>  <span style="color: green;">two</span> to  <span style="color: green;">four</span> postocular scales. Dorsal scales are smooth, rhomboidal and slightly overlapping. In some cases, these are more elongated anteriorly and becoming more compact towards the tail. Ventral scales are transversally elongated shields |  ranging in number from 249 to 280, with an average of 259.6. Anal scale is single (undivided). Subcaudal scales range from 37 to 46 with an average of 41.2, most of them divided but sometimes fused towards the tip of the tail. Background colouration ranges between greyish brown, light sandy colour, and a more reddish ochre. The spots or blotches on top are much darker, ranging from chocolate brown to a reddish dark brown. Shape and distribution of the spots is very variable. They tend to have  <span style="color: green;">ragged edges</span> and be irregular in shape. Spots sometimes fuse on the back, creating  <span style="color: green;">large</span> continuous and irregular patches. Sometimes (e.g. specimens from Magnetic Island, Queensland), blotches are small and uniformly speckled along the body, and can be quite faint. There is a slightly iridescent sheen to the skin (Esquerré et al. 2021). Diagnosis (peninsularis). The clade found in our analyses that we call maculosa a. It differs from Antaresia perthensis by having highly contrasted  <span style="color: green;">large</span> dark blotches with usually  <span style="color: green;">ragged edges</span> along the body (vs less contrasted blotches and dots), a larger  <span style="color: red;">body size</span> (max. SVL 1320 mm vs 670 mm) and a higher number of  <span style="color: red;">ventrals</span> (252–287 vs 213–247). It differs from A. childreni by lacking a space between the blotches in the anterior third of the body creating a pale lateral stripe and by normally having more  <span style="color: green;">ragged edges</span> on its blotches. There are no consistent morphological diagnostic characters to differentiate it from A. maculosa maculosa, but it can be differentiated from it by various nucleotide substitutions in the cyt-b gene (see Table S7). From the species in the Torres Strait and New Guinea it is differentiated by having larger and more contrasting blotches (vs smaller scattered dots), and by never having less than  <span style="color: green;">four</span>  <span style="color: red;">prefrontal scales</span> (vs sometimes having  <span style="color: green;">two</span> or three prefrontals), and by never having less than three postocular scales (vs sometimes having  <span style="color: green;">two</span> postoculars) (Esquerré et al. 2021).<br>
Apodora papuana	Serpentes	Pythonidae	Description. Kluge 1993 did not diagnose Apodora, but Barker et al. 2015 provide the following characterization: “Apodora papuana in life is starkly different from any of the other species in Liasis. Though there are general overall similarities between Apodora papuana and Liasis olivaceus (i.e. both are  <span style="color: green;">large</span> brown elongated snakes with similarly high counts of ventral scales), perceivable similarities end there. We have extensive experience with living specimens of Apodora, and also with all taxa of Liasis (fuscus, dunni, mackloti, savuensis, olivaceus) excepting L. olivaceus barroni. We have observed that A. papuana has the remarkable ability to change the colour of its head, eyes, and body, each independent of the other |  this is not observed (or reported) in Liasis. Furthermore, Apodora has a  <span style="color: green;">low</span>  <span style="color: red;">neural spine</span> on the vertebrae of the neck and body relative to Liasis, a primitive condition (Scanlon & Mackness, 2002). Apodora has  <span style="color: green;">darkly pigmented</span>  <span style="color: red;">skin</span>  including the lining of the mouth and cloaca, and has an extremely long and deeply forked  <span style="color: red;">tongue</span>  According to Parker (1982), Apodora appears to easily slough  <span style="color: red;">skin</span> |  this has not been observed by us and has not been reported in Liasis. Apodora has  <span style="color: red;">thermoreceptive pits</span> in the  <span style="color: red;">rostral</span> while Liasis species generally do not (individual specimens of L. mackloti may show shallow  <span style="color: red;">rostral</span> pits, (Barker and Barker, pers. obs. |  McDowell, 1975). When corrected for size (SVL), the  <span style="color: red;">eggs</span> of Apodora are  <span style="color: green;">relatively larger</span> than those of any of the four Liasis species with whose  <span style="color: red;">eggs</span> which we have experience (Barker and Barker, unpubl. data).” Description (tornieri): “ <span style="color: red;">rostral</span> <span style="color: green;">two times as broad as deep</span>  clearly visible from above, with a shallow groove on each side |  <span style="color: red;">internasals</span> <span style="color: green;">one time and a half as long as broad</span>  two thirds the length of the  <span style="color: red;">praefrontals</span>  which separate the posterior pair of small  <span style="color: red;">praefrontals</span> |  <span style="color: red;">frontal</span> <span style="color: green;">about one time and one fourth as long as broad</span>  as long as its distance from the  <span style="color: red;">rostral</span> |  <span style="color: green;">a pair</span> of  <span style="color: red;">parietals</span> |  a single  <span style="color: green;">large</span>  <span style="color: red;">loreal</span> |  a  <span style="color: green;">large</span> <span style="color: red;">praeocular</span>  with a  <span style="color: green;">very small</span>  <span style="color: red;">subocular</span> below it (on one side) |  <span style="color: green;">three elongate</span>  <span style="color: red;">postoculars</span> |  eleven upper labials, first to third with a groove, fifth and sixth entering the eye |  three posterior lower labials grooved.

Leiopython albertisii	Serpentes	Pythonidae	Diagnosis: Leiopython albertisii is distinguishable from Leiopython hoserae, Leiopython bennettorum, and Leiopython huonensis sp. nov. by the presence of  <span style="color: green;">two</span> pairs of  <span style="color: red;">parietals</span>  A pair of large scales often separated from the median line by one or more  <span style="color: green;">small</span>  <span style="color: red;">interparietal</span> follows the anterior pair (Fig. 2A). It further differs from the former  <span style="color: green;">two</span> species and from Leiopython fredparkeri sp. nov. by the presence of  <span style="color: green;">whitish</span>  <span style="color: red;">postocular spots</span>  and can easily be distinguished from Leiopython bennettorum in the number of  <span style="color: red;">loreals</span> and  <span style="color: red;">prefrontals</span> (Table 3), the average number of postoculars), <span style="color: red;">dorsal midbody rows</span>  ventrals, and  <span style="color: red;">subcaudal scales</span>  Leiopython albertisii further differs from Leiopython hoserae and from Leiopython fredparkeri in  <span style="color: green;">lighter</span>  <span style="color: red;">dorsal color</span> and in having a yellowish flank (Parker, 1982 |  Barker and Barker, 1994 |  O’Shea, 1996, 2007), smaller average  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">body</span> size</span> in hatchlings and adults, and additionally from Leiopython hoserae by molecular evidence (see Fig. 4). Leiopython albertisii can be distinguished from Leiopython biakensis sp. nov. by  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">higher</span> average</span> subcaudal (71.5 +/- 2.85 |  range = 65–79, N = 30 vs. 67.5 +/3.54 |  range = 65–70, N = 2), and  <span style="color: red;">supralabial scale counts</span> (12.9 +/- 0.28 |  range = 12–13, N = 30 vs. 11.8 +/- 0.35 |  range = 11–12, N = 2) along with a  <span style="color: green;">higher</span> number of  <span style="color: red;">supralabials entering the eye</span> (3.0 +/- 0.18 |  range = 2–3, N = 30 vs. 2, N = 2) [SCHLEIP 2008]. Diagnosis (albertisii): Leiopython albertisii is distinguished from L. meridionalis by its  <span style="color: green;">dark yellow or golden</span> dorsal colouration (versus dark brown or black in L. meridionalis) |  presence of  <span style="color: green;">small</span> specks of white patterning on the  <span style="color: red;">postocular scales</span> in most specimens |  and generally  <span style="color: green;">two</span> parietal scale pairs (as opposed to a  <span style="color: green;">single pair</span> in most L. meridionalis). Compared to L. meridionalis, L. albertisii possesses a shorter and nar- rower  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">head</span> size</span> relative to its  <span style="color: red;">body</span> (Natusch and Lyons, 2012). Leiopython albertisii also differs from L. meridionalis in having a  <span style="color: green;">lower</span> mean number of  <span style="color: red;">dorsal midbody rows</span> and a  <span style="color: green;">higher</span> mean number of  <span style="color: red;">ventral scales</span> (259–283 versus 258–275, respectively). However, an overlap in the ranges of the scale counts, coupled with  <span style="color: green;">small</span> sample sizes for this wide-ranging taxon, renders these aspects of scalation of doubtful diagnostic value. Importantly, L. albertisii is easily differentiated from L. meridionalis on the basis of molecular genetic data (Natusch et al. 2020). Description (albertisii): Leiopython albertisii is a large and robust python spe- cies growing to almost 2.5 m in total length and ~ 3.5 kg in mass in wild (Natusch and Lyons, 2012). The  <span style="color: red;">head</span> is black or dark brown dorsally and is  <span style="color: green;">distinct</span> from the neck. The  <span style="color: red;">jaws</span> are  <span style="color: green;">white ventrally</span> with  <span style="color: green;">thin black bars</span> on the anterior edges of the supralabial and  <span style="color: red;">infralabial scales</span>  A white postocular spot is  <span style="color: green;">present</span> in most specimens (McDowell, 1975 |  Schleip, 2008). The  <span style="color: red;">body</span> is  <span style="color: green;">dark yellow or golden</span> dorsally, becoming  <span style="color: green;">lighter</span> laterally and fading to  <span style="color: green;">white or cream</span> on the  <span style="color: red;">ventral surface</span>  The  <span style="color: red;">head</span> and  <span style="color: red;">body</span> are  <span style="color: green;">strongly</span>  <span style="color: red;">iridescent</span>  The  <span style="color: red;">sexes</span> do not appear to be sexually dimorphic (Natusch and Lyons, 2012, Natusch et al. 2020). Diagnosis (biakensis). This species differs from Leiopython albertisii in having only  <span style="color: green;">two</span>  <span style="color: red;">labials entering the orbit</span> (100%, N 5 2) and in  <span style="color: green;">lower</span>  <span style="color: red;">ventral scale counts</span> (271 6 1.41 |  range 5 270–272, N 5 2) than found in specimens from the western part of Papua (278 6 2.49 |  range 5 274–283, N 5 13 |  KW-test: x21 5 4.99, P , 0.05 |  see also Brongersma, 1956). However, <span style="color: red;">ventral scales</span> counts are in the range of specimens from PNG. It differs from Leiopython fredparkeri in the  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">head</span> scale arrangement</span>  with this species having  <span style="color: green;">large and wide</span> posterior  <span style="color: red;">parietals</span>  whereas Leiopython fredparkeri shows  <span style="color: green;">two</span> slender elongate posterior  <span style="color: red;">parietal scales</span> (Fig. 2). It further differs from the latter species by the presence of  <span style="color: green;">whitish</span>  <span style="color: red;">postocular spots</span>  and additionally from Leiopython huonensis and Leiopython hoserae in having  <span style="color: green;">two</span> pairs of  <span style="color: red;">parietals</span>  It is also distinguishable from Leiopython bennettorum in the number of  <span style="color: red;">prefrontals</span> and  <span style="color: red;">loreals</span> (Schleip 2008). Diagnosis (huonensis): This species differs from Leiopython albertisii, Leiopython biakensis, and Leiopython fredparkeri in having only one pair of  <span style="color: red;">parietals</span> followed by  <span style="color: green;">small</span>  irregular scales (Fig. 2C, 6I). It can be distinguished from Leiopython bennettorum by the  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">lower</span> number</span> of loreal and prefrontal scales as well as a  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">lower</span> average number</span> of  <span style="color: red;">postoculars</span> (KW-test: x21 5 3.95, P , 0.05) and from Leiopython hoserae by the  <span style="color: red;">scale arrangement</span> posterior to the  <span style="color: red;">parietal scales</span> showing  <span style="color: green;">small</span>  irregular scales. It also differs from Leiopython albertisii (KW-test: x21 5 10.31, P , 0.001) and from Leiopython hoserae (KW-test: x21 5 5.35, P , 0.05) by  <span style="color: green;">lower</span> average  <span style="color: red;">ventral scale counts</span>  Additionally, it can be distinguished from the latter taxon by the presence of the  <span style="color: green;">whitish</span> postocular spot (Schleip 2008).<br>

It further differs from the former  <span style="color: green;">two</span> species and from Leiopython fredparkeri sp. nov. by the presence of  <span style="color: green;">whitish</span>  <span style="color: red;">postocular spots</span>  and can easily be distinguished from Leiopython bennettorum in the number of  <span style="color: red;">loreals</span> and  <span style="color: red;">prefrontals</span> (Table 3), the average number of postoculars), <span style="color: red;">dorsal midbody rows</span>  ventrals, and  <span style="color: red;">subcaudal scales</span>  Leiopython albertisii further differs from Leiopython hoserae and from Leiopython fredparkeri in  <span style="color: green;">lighter</span>  <span style="color: red;">dorsal color</span> and in having a yellowish flank (Parker, 1982 |  Barker and Barker, 1994 |  O’Shea, 1996, 2007), smaller average  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">body</span> size</span> in hatchlings and adults, and additionally from Leiopython hoserae by molecular evidence (see Fig. 4). Leiopython albertisii can be distinguished from Leiopython biakensis sp. nov. by  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">higher</span> average</span> subcaudal (71.5 +/- 2.85 |  range = 65–79, N = 30 vs. 67.5 +/3.54 |  range = 65–70, N = 2), and  <span style="color: red;">supralabial scale counts</span> (12.9 +/- 0.28 |  range = 12–13, N = 30 vs. 11.8 +/- 0.35 |  range = 11–12, N = 2) along with a  <span style="color: green;">higher</span> number of  <span style="color: red;">supralabials entering the eye</span> (3.0 +/- 0.18 |  range = 2–3, N = 30 vs. 2, N = 2) [SCHLEIP 2008]. Diagnosis (albertisii): Leiopython albertisii is distinguished from L. meridionalis by its  <span style="color: green;">dark yellow or golden</span> dorsal colouration (versus dark brown or black in L. meridionalis) |  presence of  <span style="color: green;">small</span> specks of white patterning on the  <span style="color: red;">postocular scales</span> in most specimens |  and generally  <span style="color: green;">two</span> parietal scale pairs (as opposed to a  <span style="color: green;">single pair</span> in most L. meridionalis). Compared to L. meridionalis, L. albertisii possesses a shorter and nar- rower  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">head</span> size</span> relative to its  <span style="color: red;">body</span> (Natusch and Lyons, 2012). Leiopython albertisii also differs from L. meridionalis in having a  <span style="color: green;">lower</span> mean number of  <span style="color: red;">dorsal midbody rows</span> and a  <span style="color: green;">higher</span> mean number of  <span style="color: red;">ventral scales</span> (259–283 versus 258–275, respectively). However, an overlap in the ranges of the scale counts, coupled with  <span style="color: green;">small</span> sample sizes for this wide-ranging taxon, renders these aspects of scalation of doubtful diagnostic value. Importantly, L. albertisii is easily differentiated from L. meridionalis on the basis of molecular genetic data (Natusch et al. 2020). Description (albertisii): Leiopython albertisii is a large and robust python spe- cies growing to almost 2.5 m in total length and ~ 3.5 kg in mass in wild (Natusch and Lyons, 2012). The  <span style="color: red;">head</span> is black or dark brown dorsally and is  <span style="color: green;">distinct</span> from the neck. The  <span style="color: red;">jaws</span> are  <span style="color: green;">white ventrally</span> with  <span style="color: green;">thin black bars</span> on the anterior edges of the supralabial and  <span style="color: red;">infralabial scales</span>  A white postocular spot is  <span style="color: green;">present</span> in most specimens (McDowell, 1975 |  Schleip, 2008). The  <span style="color: red;">body</span> is  <span style="color: green;">dark yellow or golden</span> dorsally, becoming  <span style="color: green;">lighter</span> laterally and fading to  <span style="color: green;">white or cream</span> on the  <span style="color: red;">ventral surface</span>  The  <span style="color: red;">head</span> and  <span style="color: red;">body</span> are  <span style="color: green;">strongly</span>  <span style="color: red;">iridescent</span>  The  <span style="color: red;">sexes</span> do not appear to be sexually dimorphic (Natusch and Lyons, 2012, Natusch et al. 2020). Diagnosis (biakensis). This species differs from Leiopython albertisii in having only  <span style="color: green;">two</span>  <span style="color: red;">labials entering the orbit</span> (100%, N 5 2) and in  <span style="color: green;">lower</span>  <span style="color: red;">ventral scale counts</span> (271 6 1.41 |  range 5 270–272, N 5 2) than found in specimens from the western part of Papua (278 6 2.49 |  range 5 274–283, N 5 13 |  KW-test: x21 5 4.99, P , 0.05 |  see also Brongersma, 1956). However, <span style="color: red;">ventral scales</span> counts are in the range of specimens from PNG. It differs from Leiopython fredparkeri in the  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">head</span> scale arrangement</span>  with this species having  <span style="color: green;">large and wide</span> posterior  <span style="color: red;">parietals</span>  whereas Leiopython fredparkeri shows  <span style="color: green;">two</span> slender elongate posterior  <span style="color: red;">parietal scales</span> (Fig. 2). It further differs from the latter species by the presence of  <span style="color: green;">whitish</span>  <span style="color: red;">postocular spots</span>  and additionally from Leiopython huonensis and Leiopython hoserae in having  <span style="color: green;">two</span> pairs of  <span style="color: red;">parietals</span>  It is also distinguishable from Leiopython bennettorum in the number of  <span style="color: red;">prefrontals</span> and  <span style="color: red;">loreals</span> (Schleip 2008). Diagnosis (huonensis): This species differs from Leiopython albertisii, Leiopython biakensis, and Leiopython fredparkeri in having only one pair of  <span style="color: red;">parietals</span> followed by  <span style="color: green;">small</span>  irregular scales (Fig. 2C, 6I). It can be distinguished from Leiopython bennettorum by the  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">lower</span> number</span> of loreal and prefrontal scales as well as a  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">lower</span> average number</span> of  <span style="color: red;">postoculars</span> (KW-test: x21 5 3.95, P , 0.05) and from Leiopython hoserae by the  <span style="color: red;">scale arrangement</span> posterior to the  <span style="color: red;">parietal scales</span> showing  <span style="color: green;">small</span>  irregular scales. It also differs from Leiopython albertisii (KW-test: x21 5 10.31, P , 0.001) and from Leiopython hoserae (KW-test: x21 5 5.35, P , 0.05) by  <span style="color: green;">lower</span> average  <span style="color: red;">ventral scale counts</span>  Additionally, it can be distinguished from the latter taxon by the presence of the  <span style="color: green;">whitish</span> postocular spot (Schleip 2008).<br>

Python spilotus variegatus examined: Northern Territory (N.T.M.): Oenpelli, R1191, R1198 |  19 km S.W. of Oenpelli, R3421 |  5 km W. of the South Alligator River crossing (on Arnhem Highway), R6252 |  Darwin, R2040, R2114, R2564, R3317, R5290, R6253, R6534 |  25 km S., 8 km E. of Noonamah, R4772 |  Melville Island, R1202 |  Bathurst Island, R5276 |  Groote Eylandt, R6218, R7479, R7480, R7481. Colour notes: As in Python spilotus variegatus, dorsal color pattern extremely variable. Dorsal colouration in life reddish to dark brown with numerous irregular, pale fawn to yellow, dark edge blotches, stripes and bars. This patterning is darker and thus more intense posteriorly (Plate 1). Vental surface creamish white, posterior  <span style="color: red;">ventral</span> irregularly edged with black on anterior margins and sides. Head coloration same as dorsum |  supralabial area creamish, with brown blotches. Colouration of  <span style="color: red;">infralabials</span> and gulars as for  <span style="color: red;">ventral</span> surface. Dorsal patterning of hatchling P. bredli resembles adults, but more pronounced due to brighter colouration. Hatchlings of Northern Territory P. s. variegatus, (less than 500 mm total length) pinkishred with indistinct patterning. (Gow 1981) Comparison of Python bredli and Python spilotus variegatus: Table 1 compares the more important meristic characteristics that separate these two species. P. bredli differs markedly from P. spilotus variegatus in the number of  <span style="color: red;">dorsal scale rows</span> at the fifteenth and median ventrals, and the number of scales in a median line between orbits (excluding supraoculars). Overlap occurs in all other characters listed. In P. bredli labial counts are normally higher by about two scales. In addition the  <span style="color: red;">supralabials</span> which enter the  <span style="color: red;">orbit</span> (Figure 1.), the number (Table 1) and placement of infralabial sensory pits (Figure 2), and the number of scales which surround  <span style="color: red;">orbit</span> (including supralabials) (Figure 3.) are also generally more numerous. Figure 4 show the head scalation of both P. bredli (4a) and P. spilotus variegatus. (4b). Scales in the loreal and  <span style="color: red;">frontal</span> regions are noticeably smaller and more numerous in P. bredli. There is little difference In body proportions, apart from total length, in which P. bredli easily exceeds P. spilotus variegatus (Table 1). Smaller specimens (less than 1500 mm total length) of both species, are more compressed laterally than large adults. In the Northern Territory the two species are geographically separated by more than 500 km. (Gow 1981)<br>
Morelia carinata	Serpentes	Pythonidae	Diagnosis: Distinguished from other species of Python by having keeled dorsal scales (Smith 1981) Description of holotype: <span style="color: red;">tail</span> <span style="color: green;">not prehensile</span>  <span style="color: red;">cloacal spurs</span> <span style="color: green;">present</span>  <span style="color: red;">rostral</span> with  <span style="color: green;">angular apex</span>  and a pair of  <span style="color: green;">oblique</span>  <span style="color: red;">sensory pits</span> |  almost as wide as high, penetrating deeply between the  <span style="color: red;">internasals</span> which are separ- ated by  <span style="color: green;">2 small median scales</span>  <span style="color: red;">anterior prefrontals</span> broken into  <span style="color: green;">4 symmetric parts</span>  anterior pair of fragments in contact, posterior pair separated by a scale. <span style="color: red;">frontal</span> <span style="color: green;">oval (9 x 8 mm)</span>  Four  <span style="color: red;">supraoculars</span> (third largest) separated from  <span style="color: red;">frontal</span> by a row of small scales. <span style="color: red;">remainder of head shields</span> asymmetric- ally divided. <span style="color: red;">loreals</span> <span style="color: green;">small, numerous</span>  sharply differentiated from other scales. <span style="color: red;">upper labials</span> <span style="color: green;">14 and 15, seventh and eighth entering orbit</span> (both sides), first 3 on each side with an  <span style="color: green;">oblique</span> pit. <span style="color: red;">lower labials</span> 16 and 17 with pits in labials 9-14, and 10-14. <span style="color: red;">mental groove</span> <span style="color: green;">deep, bordered on each side</span> by first lower labial and about 15 scales, all much smaller than adjacent gular scales. <span style="color: red;">ventrals</span> <span style="color: green;">298</span>  <span style="color: red;">anal scale</span> <span style="color: green;">entire</span>  <span style="color: red;">subcaudals</span> <span style="color: green;">83, all but numbers 4-6 and 73-80 divided</span>  <span style="color: red;">scale rows at midbody</span> 45 |  at neck 41 and at  <span style="color: red;">tail</span> 30. Dorsal imbricate, scales in first and last 4 or 5 rows smooth, remainder with a short, blunt keel (keels strongest on mid-dorsal scales).

(Smith 1981)  Coloration: Head brownish, unpatterned except for 2 vague whitish streaks on the temporals. Ground colour of dorsum brownish -white with dark brown varie- gation and blotches. Ground colour becoming paler and blotches darker posteriorly, thus increasing contrast in pattern. <span style="color: red;">ventrals</span> mostly off-white, every second to fifth smudged brown.

Nyctophilopython oenpelliensis	Serpentes	Pythonidae	Diagnosis and definition (genus): A lineage endemic to northern Australia that underwent a rapid divergence from Antaresia and Morelia, and showing intermediate traits between the two. They are slender and long snakes, with adults  <span style="color: green;">up to over 4 meters</span> in  <span style="color: red;">total length</span>  larger than any Morelia and especially the dwarfed Antaresia. Pale brownish to olive coloration, with longitudinal rows of large dark blotches. Enlarged nasal, internasal, anterior pre-frontals, supraocular and frontal symmetrical head shields. The  <span style="color: red;">posterior prefrontals</span> are usually  <span style="color: green;">several smaller asymmetrical scales</span>  In Morelia head scales are smaller and more divided, in Antaresia and Simalia there are no small divided  <span style="color: red;">posterior prefrontals</span>  <span style="color: red;">heat pits</span> <span style="color: green;">present</span> on rostral, first three supralabials and posterior infralabial scales. They are the only pythons with over 400 ventral scales. Along with Aspidites, this is one of the two python genera that are endemic to Australia (Esquerré et al. 2020). Diagnosis: “A genus of large elongate pythons possessing strongly prehensile tails, deeply pitted anterior labials, indistinct parietal shield formation that results in almost total dorsal head scale fragmentation, fragmented loreals, smooth body scales in 70 rows, from about 425 to 450 ventral scutes, entire anal scale, 155 to 165 subcaudals (anterior few entire, remainder divided), oviparous reproduction and a maximum size of around 5 metres. Known only from the extreme northern sector of the Northern Territory.” (Wells & Wellington 1985: 42).<br>
Morelia spilota	Serpentes	Pythonidae	Diagnosis (genus): This is a  <span style="color: red;">genus</span> of pythonid snakes of  <span style="color: green;">large size</span>  with  <span style="color: red;">adult lengths</span> of > <span style="color: green;">2 m to 5.5 m</span>  This  <span style="color: red;">genus</span> is shown to be a  <span style="color: red;">monophyletic clade</span> separated from all other python clades on the basis of  <span style="color: green;">molecular characters</span> as illustrated in Figure 6 (in Barker et al. 2015, Pyron et al., 2013). Likewise, the morphological analysis illustrated in Figure 1 (Kluge, 1993) shows the split as internal to Morelia. <span style="color: red;">simalia</span> shares a common ancestor with the clade of pythons comprised of Morelia, Apodora, Liasis, Aspidites, Antaresia, Leiopython, and Bothrochilus. <span style="color: red;">simalia</span> can be separated from Apodora, Aspidites, Antaresia, and Liasis by the presence and condition of the  <span style="color: red;">thermoreceptive pits</span> on the  <span style="color: green;">supralabials and rostral</span>  Species in  <span style="color: red;">simalia</span> have two large, deep  <span style="color: red;">thermoreceptive pits</span> on the rostral scale and well developed  <span style="color: red;">thermoreceptive pits</span> on 2–5 anterior supralabials |  Aspidites and Bothrochilus have no  <span style="color: red;">thermoreceptive pits</span> on the rostral and supralabials |  Antaresia and Liasis typically have no pits in the rostral. Apodora has shallow pits on the rostral and anterior 2–3 supralabials. Leiopython varies in the condition of labial pits |  most have a pitted rostral and the first 2–3 supralabials may have pits. <span style="color: red;">simalia</span> have  <span style="color: green;">subloreal scales</span>  while Kluge (1993) did not observe  <span style="color: green;">subloreal scales</span> in Bothrochilus or Leiopython |  species in  <span style="color: red;">simalia</span> have > 4 loreal scales while Bothrochilus and Leiopython have 1–2. <span style="color: red;">simalia</span> has a  <span style="color: green;">strongly prehensile</span>  <span style="color: red;">tail</span>  while the  <span style="color: red;">tail</span> of Aspidites, Antaresia, Leiopython, and Liasis is weakly prehensile (McDowell, 1975). <span style="color: red;">simalia</span> can be distinguished from Morelia by the condition of the  <span style="color: red;">head scalation</span>  Species in  <span style="color: red;">simalia</span> have  <span style="color: green;">large plate-like head scales</span> identified as  <span style="color: red;">supraoculars</span>  <span style="color: green;">frontals</span>  and one or more pairs of  <span style="color: red;">parietals</span>  <span style="color: red;">simalia</span> oenpelliensis varies from this formula, and has small  <span style="color: red;">parietals</span> and  <span style="color: green;">irregular scalation</span> posterior to large  <span style="color: red;">supraoculars</span> that are in full contact with a large frontal. The only large scales that might be considered ‘platelike’ on the  <span style="color: red;">dorsal surface</span> of the head of Morelia species are small  <span style="color: red;">internasals</span> and  <span style="color: green;">anterior prefrontals</span> on the front of the snout. M. carinata is one exception and it typically has a single round frontal centered between the eyes and surrounded by  <span style="color: green;">small scales</span>  separated from contact with relatively large anterior  <span style="color: red;">supraoculars</span> (Barker et al. 2015: 13).

Coloration: Shine et al. (1998) classified this species into four types, based on their predominant dorsal colour: brown, orange, red or yellow. In the study area, all blood pythons are brown or orange-brown at hatching, and develop their adult colours gradually. The analyses of DNA sequence data by Shine et al. revealed no genetic differences between the colour morphs of P. brongersmai (S. Keogh et al., unpublished work |  cited in Shine et al.). Studies of captive snakes indicate that all four colour morphs are interfertile and readily interbreed, with offspring from a single litter often developing into adults of two or three colour morphs (Barker and Barker 1996 |  D. and T. Barker, personal communication, cited in Shine et al.). However, the four colour morphs of P. brongersmai differed significantly in most of the traits that Shine et al. measured. In both sexes, for example, red snakes were substantially larger and heavier than yellow snakes. Scalation: The  <span style="color: red;">ventral scale count</span> is >167 in brongersmai but <165 in the other forms (GH Rodda, pers. comm.).<br>

Leiopython fredparkeri	Serpentes	Pythonidae	Diagnosis: Leiopython meridionalis is distinguished from L. albertisii by dark grey, brown or black dorsal colouration (versus  <span style="color: green;">dark yellow or golden</span> in L. albertisii) |  absence of  <span style="color: green;">small</span> specks of white patterning on the  <span style="color: red;">postocular scales</span> in all specimens |  generally a  <span style="color: green;">single pair</span> of  <span style="color: red;">parietal scales</span> (as opposed to  <span style="color: green;">two</span> pairs in most L. albertisii) |  and a  <span style="color: green;">higher</span> mean number of  <span style="color: red;">dorsal midbody scales</span> and  <span style="color: green;">fewer</span>  <span style="color: red;">ventral scales</span> than L. al- bertisii. Relative to its  <span style="color: red;">body</span> length, L. meridionalis has a  <span style="color: green;">longer</span> and  <span style="color: green;">wider</span>  <span style="color: red;">head</span> than L. albertisii and preliminary data suggest that L. mer- idionalis grows to a  <span style="color: green;">larger</span> maximum  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">body</span> size</span> (Natusch and Lyons, 2012). Leiopython meridionalis is easily differentiated from L. albertisii on the basis of  <span style="color: red;">molecular genetic information</span> (Natusch et al. 2020). Description: Leiopython meridionalis is a large and robust python species growing to > 2.5 m in total length and ~ 3.5 kg in mass in wild (Natusch and Lyons, 2012). The  <span style="color: red;">head</span> is  <span style="color: green;">black dorsally</span> and  <span style="color: green;">distinct</span> from the neck. The  <span style="color: red;">jaws</span> are  <span style="color: green;">white ventrally</span> with  <span style="color: green;">thin black bars</span> on the anterior edges of the supralabial and  <span style="color: red;">infralabial scales</span> (McDowell, 1975 |  Schleip, 2008). The  <span style="color: red;">body</span> is dark grey or brown to black, becoming  <span style="color: green;">lighter</span> laterally and fading to  <span style="color: green;">white or cream</span> on the  <span style="color: red;">ventral surface</span>  The  <span style="color: red;">head</span> and  <span style="color: red;">body</span> are  <span style="color: green;">strongly</span>  <span style="color: red;">iridescent</span>  The  <span style="color: red;">sexes</span> do not appear to be sexually dimorphic (Natusch et al. 2020). Diagnosis. Leiopython hoserae can be distinguished from Leiopython fredparkeri, Leiopython albertisii, and Leiopython biakensis by the presence of only one pair of  <span style="color: red;">parietals</span> followed by a characteristic scale pattern of  <span style="color: green;">two</span>  <span style="color: green;">small</span> scales separated from the median line by an elongate scale that gets  <span style="color: green;">wider</span> posteriorly (see Fig. 2B, 6C in SCHLEIP 2008). It further differs from the former species in a  <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">lower</span> average number</span> of  <span style="color: red;">dorsal midbody rows</span> (KW-test: x21 = 5.68, P = 0.05), and from the latter  <span style="color: green;">two</span> species by the absence of the  <span style="color: green;">whitish</span> postocular spot. Furthermore, Leiopython hoserae exceeds Leiopython albertisii and Leiopython biakensis in adult and hatchling  <span style="color: red;"> <span style="color: red;">body</span> size</span> and is darker in color (Parker, 1982 |  Barker and Barker, 1994 |  O’Shea, 1996). Molecular evidence also supports the separation of Leiopython hoserae from Leiopython albertisii (genetic distance of up to 9.3%). It differs from Leiopython bennettorum in the number of  <span style="color: red;">loreals</span> and  <span style="color: red;">prefrontals</span> as well as in  <span style="color: green;">lower</span> midbody scale row counts (KW-test: x21 = 8.92, P = 0.01) and in the average number of  <span style="color: red;">postoculars</span> (KW-test: x21 = 7.19, P = 0.01). Leiopython hoserae can be distinguished from Leiopython huonensis by the absence of the  <span style="color: green;">whitish</span> postocular spot, the characteristic  <span style="color: red;">scale arrangement</span> in the parietal region (Leiopython huonensis has one pair of  <span style="color: red;">parietals</span> followed by  <span style="color: green;">small</span>  irregular scales) and in  <span style="color: green;">higher</span> <span style="color: red;">ventral scale counts</span> (KW-test: x21 = 6.62, P = 0.05). Leiopython hoserae also occurs in drier and hotter climate conditions than other taxa of the genus (detailed in SCHLEIP 2008). Diagnosis. Leiopython bennettorum is easily distinguishable from all other members of the genus Leiopython by  <span style="color: green;">higher</span> loreal scale count and by a second pair of  <span style="color: green;">small</span> lateral  <span style="color: red;">prefrontals</span> (Fig. 6E, F). Furthermore, <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">higher</span> average</span> midbody scale row and postocular scale counts separate this species from Leiopython hoserae (KWtest: x21 = 8.92, P = 0.01 and x21 = 7.19, P = 0.05), Leiopython huonensis (KW-test: x215 4.48, P = 0.05 and x21 = 3.95, P = 0.05), Leiopython fredparkeri (KW-test: x21 = 5.30, P = 0.05 and x21 = 4.28, P = 0.05), and Leiopython albertisii (KWtest: x21 = 7.98, P = 0.01 and x21 = 14.22, P = 0.001). It can also be distinguished from the latter  <span style="color: green;">two</span> species in having only one pair of  <span style="color: red;">parietals</span> and, additionally, differs from Leiopython albertisii and Leiopython biakensis by the absence of the  <span style="color: green;">whitish</span> postocular spot (contra Hoser, 2000, from Schleip 2008: 658). Diagnosis (montanus). A detailed diagnosis and description can be found in Schleip (2008:658–659 under the heading ‘‘Leiopython bennettorum’’ (given above). Leiopython montanus sp. nov. can be distinguished easily from all other members of the genus Leiopython by a  <span style="color: green;">higher</span> loreal scale count and by a second pair of  <span style="color: green;">small</span> lateral  <span style="color: red;">prefrontals</span>  Furthermore, <span style="color: green;"> <span style="color: green;">higher</span> average</span> midbody scale row and postocular scale counts separate this species from L. meridionalis, Leiopython huonensis (Huon White-lipped Python), L. fredparkeri, and L. albertisii (from Schleip 2014, based on 5 specimens). Diagnosis. Leiopython fredparkeri differs from Leiopython albertisii and Leiopython biakensis in the absence of the  <span style="color: green;">whitish</span> postocular spot, and in  <span style="color: green;">higher</span> infralabial counts (KW-test: x21 5 28.22, P , 0.001 and x21 5 5.06, P , 0.05). It further differs from the former species by  <span style="color: green;">lower</span> ventral counts (KW-test: x21 5 7.58, P , 0.01). This species is distinguishable from Leiopython bennettorum by loreal, prefrontal, and  <span style="color: green;">lower</span> average postocular scale counts (KW-test: x21 5 4.28, P , 0.05), from Leiopython huonensis by the absence of the  <span style="color: green;">whitish</span> postocular spot, and from the latter species and Leiopython hoserae in having  <span style="color: green;">two</span> pairs of  <span style="color: red;">parietals</span> (Schleip 2008: 659).<br>

Morelia azurea	Serpentes	Pythonidae	Diagnosis: Morelia viridis is easily distinguished from all subspecies of M. azurea by the following characters: presence of a  <span style="color: red;">single juvenile morph</span> ( <span style="color: green;">yellow</span> vs. <span style="color: green;">yellow</span> or red in M. azurea) |  presence of a tightly knitted row of white vertebral scales  <span style="color: green;">along the vertebral ridge</span>  or white ‘rosettes’ <span style="color: green;">along the vertebral ridge</span> in the Aru Islands population |  and a  <span style="color: red;">dark shade of green coloration</span> <span style="color: green;">along the vertebral ridge</span>  as opposed to uniform green in M. azurea (Table 1, Supplementary Material II). Most populations of M. viridis also possess  <span style="color: green;">short</span>  stubby tails and con- siderably  <span style="color: green;">lower</span> subcaudal scale counts vs. long, tapering tails and high subcaudal scale counts in M. azurea (Table 1, Supplementary Material II). The exceptions are populations from Milne Bay and the north coast of Oro and Morobe Provinces to near Lae, Papua New Guinea, which typically have long, tapering tails similar to M. azurea. Morelia viridis further differs from M. a. azurea and M. a. utaraensis in that juveniles possess a  <span style="color: red;">single iris band</span> running horizontally through the eye (as opposed to a triple iris band |  Table 1 |  Supplementary Material II). It further differs from M. a. utaraensis in that juveniles have a darkened tail tip and a  <span style="color: red;">broken pattern</span> <span style="color: green;">following the vertebral ridge</span> vs. a light- colored tail and continuous pattern. Morelia viridis further differs from M. a. azurea by undergoing a relatively  <span style="color: red;">rapid color change</span> to become  <span style="color: green;">uniform green in adulthood</span> vs. delayed colour change with variable coloration). [from Natusch et al. 2019] Diagnosis (pulcher): Morphologically, M. a. pulcher differs only subtly from M. azurea utaraensis in having a higher mean  <span style="color: red;">number of ventral and subcaudal scales</span>  a  <span style="color: red;">single iris band</span> in juvenile specimens, and a dark tail tip (vs. a light-colored tail tip in M. azurea utarensis). [from Natusch et al. 2019] Diagnosis (utaraensis): Morphologically, M. a. utaraensis differs only subtly from M. azurea pulcher in having a  <span style="color: green;">lower</span> mean  <span style="color: red;">number of ventral and subcaudal scales</span>  a triple iris band in juvenile specimens, and a light tail tip (vs. a dark-colored tail tip in M. azurea pulcher). Morelia a. utaraensis differs from M. a. azurea in having a  <span style="color: green;">lower</span> mean number of ventral, supralabial, infralabial and subcaudal scales, a relatively rapid onto- genetic color change, a shorter  <span style="color: red;">head</span> and snout, and a fully connected juvenile pattern (vs broken/unconnected patterning in M. a. azurea), and a light tail tip (vs dark in M. a. azurea) [from Natusch et al. 2019]<br>
Morelia imbricata	Serpentes	Pythonidae	Diagnosis: Distinguished from P. spilotus variegatus by having  <span style="color: green;">strongly imbricate, lanceolate</span> (not rhomboidal) <span style="color: red;">posterior dorsals</span>  fewer  <span style="color: red;">ventrals</span> ( <span style="color: green;">239-276</span> V. 259-294) and fewer  <span style="color: red;">subcaudals</span> ( <span style="color: green;">63-82</span> v. 75-89). (Smith 1981) Description: Smith 1981<br>
Antaresia papuensis	Serpentes	Pythonidae	Diagnosis: The clade found in our analyses that we call maculosa c. It differs from Antaresia perthensis by a  <span style="color: green;">larger</span>  <span style="color: red;">body size</span> (max. SVL 1080 mm vs 670 mm) and a higher  <span style="color: red;">number of ventrals</span> (253–284 vs 213–247). It differs from A. childreni by  <span style="color: green;">lacking a space between the blotches</span> in the  <span style="color: red;">anterior third of the body</span> creating a pale stripe and by normally having more ragged edges on its blotches. It differs from A. m. maculosa and A. m. peninsularis by having a  <span style="color: green;">far less contrasted</span>  <span style="color: red;">pattern</span> (vs a  <span style="color: red;">pattern</span> of large contrasted blotches), with small scattered spots rather than large and dark irregular blotches. It also sometimes displays  <span style="color: green;">two</span> or three prefontal scales (vs always four or more). It additionally differs from A. m. peninsularis by sometimes having  <span style="color: green;">two</span> <span style="color: red;">postocular scales</span> (vs always three or four). Description. Morphometric data of the type series can be found in Table S6. A small python, with a maximum recorded SVL of 1080 mm. Maximum  <span style="color: red;">tail length</span> (TL) is  <span style="color: green;">95 mm</span>  <span style="color: red;">average tl/svl</span> is  <span style="color: green;">0.094</span>  <span style="color: red;">average hl/svl</span> is  <span style="color: green;">0.038</span>  <span style="color: red;">average hl/hw</span> is  <span style="color: green;">1.94</span>  <span style="color: red;">maximum mid-body girth</span> is  <span style="color: green;">85 mm</span>  and it is on average  <span style="color: green;">1.72 times thicker</span> than the  <span style="color: red;">neck</span>  <span style="color: red;">head scalation</span> comprises  <span style="color: green;">large symmetrical shields</span>  <span style="color: green;">one large roughly hexagonal</span>  <span style="color: red;">frontal scale</span>  <span style="color: green;">two</span>  <span style="color: red;">parietal scales</span> directly in contact with the frontal, posterior to which scales are largely undifferentiated. Parietals in contact. One large  <span style="color: red;">supraocular</span> above each eye. <span style="color: green;">two</span> to four large  <span style="color: red;">prefrontal scales</span>  <span style="color: green;">two</span> internasal scales. Rostral scale in contact with internasals, nasal and first supralabials. There are 10–12 supralabials with an average of 10.6 |  and 10–14 infralabials with an average of 12. Four of the infralabials have conspicuous heat pits. There is a single large, anteriorly pointed preocular scale, with sometimes an additional much smaller one between this and the fourth and/or fifth supralabial scales. There are 3–5 irregularly sized loreal scales. <span style="color: green;">two</span> to four  <span style="color: red;">postocular scales</span>  Dorsal scales are smooth, rhomboidal and slightly overlapping. In some cases, these are more elongated anteriorly and becoming more compact towards the tail. Ventral scales are transversally elongated shields |  they range from 253 to 284, with an average of 270.6. Anal scale is single (undivided). Subcaudal scales range from 40 to 48 with an average of 42.8, most of them divided but sometimes fused towards the tip of the tail. Background colouration ranges between light to dark brown. There are small and irregular dark brown blotches along the dorsal surface, with ragged edges. There is a slightly iridescent sheen to the skin.<br>
